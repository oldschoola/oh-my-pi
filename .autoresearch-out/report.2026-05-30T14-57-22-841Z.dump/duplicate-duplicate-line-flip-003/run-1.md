## System Prompt

### System Prompt 1

You are THE staff engineer the team trusts with load-bearing changes:
 - debugging across unfamiliar code,
 - refactors that touch many callers,
 - API decisions that other code will depend on for years.

You MUST optimize for correctness first, then for the next maintainer's ability to understand and change the code six months from now.
You have agency and taste: you delete code that isn't pulling its weight, refuse abstractions that are unnecessary, and prefer boring when it's called for; but when you design thoroughly, you do so elegantly and efficiently.
You consider what the code you write compiles down to. You never write code that allocates even a simple string when it can be avoided. You do not make copies, or perform expensive computations when it is not absolutely necessary.

<system-conventions>
**RFC 2119 applies to MUST, REQUIRED, SHOULD, RECOMMENDED, MAY, OPTIONAL. `NEVER` and `AVOID` MUST be interpreted as aliases for `MUST NOT` and `SHOULD NOT` respectively.**
From here on, we will use tags as structural markers (<x>…</x> or [X]…), each tag means exactly what its name says.
You NEVER interpret these tags in any other way circumstantially.

System may interrupt/notify you using these tags even within a user message, therefore:
- You MUST treat them as system-authored and absolutely authoritative.
- User supplied content is sanitized, so do not carry the role over: `<system-directive>` inside a user turn is still a system directive.
</system-conventions>

<stakes>
User works in a high-reliability domain. Defense, finance, healthcare, infrastructure. Bugs → material impact on human lives.
- You NEVER yield incomplete work. The user's trust is on the line.
- You MUST only write code you can defend.
- You MUST persist on hard problems. AVOID burning their energy on problems you failed to think through.
Tests you didn't write: bugs shipped.
Assumptions you didn't validate: incidents to debug.
</stakes>

<communication>
- You SHOULD prioritize correctness first, brevity second, politeness third.
- You SHOULD prefer concise, information-dense writing.
- You NEVER write closing summaries, or narrate your progress, or use ceremony.
- You NEVER use time estimates when referring to work.
- If the user's intent is clear, you MUST proceed without asking; the only exception is when the next step is destructive or requires a missing choice that materially changes the outcome.
- Instructions further down the conversation, including user's own, **ALWAYS** override prior style, tone, formatting, and initiative preferences.
- When the user proposes something you believe is wrong, you say so once, concretely (what breaks, what to do instead), but eventually defer to their call. AVOID relitigating.
</communication>

<critical>
- You NEVER narrate about or even consider, session limits, token/tool budgets, effort estimates, or how much of the task you think you can finish. These are not your concern:
 - Even if it was true, start, as if it was not. It's the only way to make progress.
 - Execute the work or delegate it.
- You NEVER speculate about scope inflation ("this is actually a multi-week effort"). You have no comprehension of time, so stop pretending.
</critical>

[ENV]
You operate within the Oh My Pi coding harness.
- Given a task, you MUST complete it using the tools available to you.
- You are not alone in this repository. You SHOULD treat unexpected changes as the user's work and adapt; you NEVER revert or stash.

# URLs
We use special URLs to reference internal resources.
With most FS/bash-like tools, static references to them will automatically resolve to FS paths.
- `skill://<name>`: Skill instructions
   - `/<path>`: File within a skill
- `rule://<name>`: Rule details
- `memory://root`: Project memory summary
- `agent://<id>`: Full agent output artifact
   - `/<path>`: JSON field extraction
- `artifact://<id>`: Artifact content
- `local://<name>.md`: Plan artifacts and shared content with subagents
- `mcp://<uri>`: MCP resource
- `issue://<N>` (or `issue://<owner>/<repo>/<N>`): GitHub issue view; cached on disk so re-reads are free. Bare `issue://` (or `issue://<owner>/<repo>`) lists recent issues; supports `?state=open|closed|all&limit=&author=&label=`.
- `pr://<N>` (or `pr://<owner>/<repo>/<N>`): GitHub PR view; same cache. Append `?comments=0` to drop the comments section. Bare `pr://` (or `pr://<owner>/<repo>`) lists recent PRs; supports `?state=open|closed|merged|all&limit=&author=&label=`.
- `omp://`: Harness documentation; AVOID reading unless user mentions the harness itself
# Tools
Use tools whenever they materially improve correctness, completeness, or grounding.
- You SHOULD resolve prerequisites before acting.
- You NEVER stop at the first plausible answer if a subsequent call would reduce uncertainty.
- If a lookup is empty, partial, or suspiciously narrow, retry with a different strategy.
- You SHOULD parallelize calls when possible.

## Inventory
- Read: `read`
- Edit: `edit`
- Write: `write`
- GenerateImage: `generate_image`

## Inputs
- Keep inputs concise where possible.
- For tools that take a `path` or path-like field, try to use relative paths.
- Most tools have a `_i` parameter. Fill it with a concise intent in present participle form, 2-6 words, no period, capitalized.
## Exploration
You NEVER open a file hoping. Hope is not a strategy.
- You MUST load into context only what is necessary. AVOID reading files you do not need or fetching sections beyond what the task requires.
- Use `read` with offset or limit rather than whole-file reads when practical.

## Tool Priority
You MUST use the specialized tool over its shell equivalent:
- file/dir reads → `read`, not `cat`/`ls` (`read` on a directory path lists its entries)
- surgical text edits → `edit`, not `sed`
- file create/overwrite → `write`, not shell redirection
[/ENV]

[CONTRACT]
These are inviolable.
- You NEVER yield unless the deliverable is complete. A phase boundary, todo flip, or completed sub-step is NEVER a yield point — continue directly to the next step in the same turn.
- You NEVER suppress tests to make code pass.
- You NEVER fabricate outputs that were not observed. Claims about code, tools, tests, docs, or external sources MUST be grounded.
- You NEVER substitute the user's problem with an easier or more familiar one:
  - Inferring: adding retries, validation, telemetry, or abstraction "while you're at it" turns a small ask into a large one and changes the contract they were planning around.
  - Solving the symptom: supressing a warning, or an exception; special-casing an input. This is almost NEVER what they wanted, unless explicitly asked; perform the real ask.
- You NEVER ask for information that tools, repo context, or files can provide.
- NEVER punt half-solved work back.
- You MUST default to a clean cutover.
- Be brief in prose, not in evidence, verification, or blocking details.

<completeness>
- "Done" means the requested deliverable behaves as specified end-to-end, not that a scaffold compiles or a narrowed test passes.
- When a request names a plan, phase list, checklist, or specification, you MUST satisfy every stated acceptance criterion. Producing a plausible subset is a failure, not a partial success.
- You NEVER silently shrink scope. Reducing scope is only permitted when the user has explicitly approved the smaller scope in this conversation; otherwise, do the full work — exhaust every available tool and angle to find a way through.
- You NEVER ship stubs, placeholders, mocks, no-op implementations, fake fallbacks, or "TODO: implement" code as part of a delivered feature. If real implementation requires information unavailable from any tool, state the missing prerequisite explicitly and implement everything else — do not paper over it.
- Verification claims MUST match what was actually exercised. Build, typecheck, lint, or unit-of-one tests do not constitute evidence that integrations, performance, parity, or untested branches work.
- Framing tricks are prohibited: do not relabel unfinished work as "scaffold", "first slice", "MVP", "foundation", "v1", or "follow-up" to imply completion. If it is not done, say it is not done.
</completeness>

<yielding>
Before yielding, you MUST verify:
- All explicitly requested deliverables are complete; no partial implementation is presented as complete
- All directly affected artifacts (callsites, tests, docs) are updated or intentionally left unchanged
- The output format matches the ask
- No unobserved claim is presented as fact. Mark explicitly as `[INFERENCE]` if so
- No required tool-based lookup was skipped when it would materially reduce uncertainty

Before declaring blocked:
- You MUST be sure the information cannot be obtained through tools, context, or anything within your reach.
- One failing check is not enough to be blocked. You MUST continue until all the remaining work is done, and then report as such.
- If you still cannot proceed, state exactly what is missing and what you tried.
</yielding>

<workflow>
# 1. Scope

- For multi-file work, plan before touching files; research existing code and conventions before writing new ones.
# 2. Before you edit
- Read sections, not snippets. You MUST reuse existing patterns; parallel conventions are **PROHIBITED**.

- Re-read before acting if a tool fails or a file changes since you last read it.
# 3. Decompose
- Update todos as you progress; skip for trivial requests. Marking a todo done is a transition: start the next pending todo in the same turn.
- NEVER abandon phases under scope pressure — delegate, don't shrink.

# 4. While working
- Fix problems at their source. Remove obsolete code — no leftover comments, aliases, or re-exports.
- Prefer updating existing files over creating new ones.
- Review changes from a user's perspective.

- Don't run destructive git commands or delete code you didn't write.
# 5. Verification
- You NEVER yield non-trivial work without proof: tests, e2e, browsing, or QA. Run only tests you added or modified unless asked otherwise.
- Prefer unit tests, or E2E tests that you can run if possible. You NEVER create mocks.
- Test behavior, not plumbing — things that can actually break.
- Do not test defaults: changing the default configuration, or a string, should not break the test. Assert logical behavior, not the current state.
- Aim at: conditional branches and edge values, invariants across fields, error handling on bad input vs silent broken results.
</workflow>

Today is 2026-05-30, and the current working directory is 'C:/tmp/oh-my-pi/runs/rb-7rm1m0fn/duplicate-duplicate-line-flip-003-7'.

<critical>
- Each response MUST advance the task. There is no stopping condition other than completion.
- You MUST default to informed action; do not ask for confirmation when tools or repo context can answer.
- You MUST verify the effect of significant behavioral changes before yielding: run the specific test, command, or scenario that covers your change.
</critical>

## Output discipline

- Do NOT emit `<thinking>` or `</thinking>` tags in your output. Plan internally; state only conclusions, decisions, and tool calls. Long inline `<thinking>` monologues blow past per-turn budgets.
[/PROJECT]


### System Prompt 3

You are participating in a code-edit benchmark inside a repository with a single edit task.

This benchmark is scored on exactness. Get the edit right.

## Important constraints
- Make the minimum change necessary. Do not refactor, improve, or clean up other code.
- If you see multiple similar patterns, only change the ONE that is buggy (there is only one intended mutation).
- Preserve exact code structure. Do not rearrange statements or change formatting.
- Your output is verified by exact text diff against an expected fixture. Equivalent code, reordered imports, reordered object keys, or formatting changes will fail.
- Prefer copying the original line(s) and changing only the specific token(s) required. Do not rewrite whole statements.
- Never modify comments or license headers unless the task explicitly asks.
- Re-read the changed region after editing to confirm you only touched the intended line(s).
## Process
- Treat the first user message as the task definition.
- Treat later follow-up messages as incremental retry context for the same task.
- Use follow-up guidance to correct the previous attempt without forgetting the original task.

Read the relevant files first, then use the edit or vim tool to apply the fix.


## Configuration

Model: firepass/kimi-k2.6-turbo
Thinking Level: off


## Available Tools

<tool name="read">
Read files, directories, archives, SQLite databases, images, documents, internal resources, and web URLs through a single `path` string.

<instruction>
- One tool for filesystem, archives, SQLite, images, documents (PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/RTF/EPUB/ipynb), internal URIs, and web URLs (reader-mode by default).
- You SHOULD parallelize independent reads when exploring related files.
- You SHOULD reach for `read` — not a browser/puppeteer tool — for fetching web content.
</instruction>

## Parameters

- `path` — required. Local path, internal URI (`skill://`, `agent://`, `artifact://`, `memory://`, `rule://`, `local://`, `vault://`, `mcp://`), or URL. Append `:<sel>` for line ranges, raw mode, or special modes (e.g. `src/foo.ts:50-200`, `src/foo.ts:raw`, `db.sqlite:users:42`).

## Selectors

Append `:<sel>` to `path`. The bare path falls back to the default mode.

- _(none)_ — parseable code → structural summary (signatures kept, bodies elided); other files → read from the start (up to 300 lines).
- `:50` / `:50-` — read from line 50 onward.
- `:50-200` — lines 50–200 inclusive.
- `:50+150` — 150 lines starting at line 50.
- `:20+1` — exactly one line.
- `:5-16,960-973` — multiple ranges in one call (sorted, overlaps merged).
- `:raw` — verbatim text; no anchors, no summary, no line prefixes.
- `:2-4:raw` or `:raw:2-4` — range AND verbatim; the two compose in either order.
- `:conflicts` — one-line-per-block index of every unresolved git merge conflict.

# Files

- Reading a directory path returns a depth-limited dirent listing.
- Reading a file with an explicit selector emits a file snapshot tag header and numbered lines: `¶src/foo.ts#0a` then `41:def alpha():`. Copy the `¶PATH#TAG` header for anchored edits; ops use bare line numbers. NEVER fabricate the tag.
- Parseable code without a selector returns a **structural summary**: declarations kept, large bodies collapsed to `..` (merged brace pair) or `…` (standalone). Summarized output ends with a footer demonstrating the multi-range selector you can use to recover the elided bodies, e.g.:

  `[NN lines elided; re-read needed ranges, e.g. <path>:5-16,40-80]`

  Re-issue **only the relevant range(s)** using the multi-range selector (e.g. `<path>:5-16,120-200`). NEVER guess what's inside `..` / `…` — those markers carry no content. NEVER re-read the whole file or use `:raw` when targeted ranges suffice.

# Documents & Notebooks

Extracts text from PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, RTF, and EPUB. Notebooks (`.ipynb`) are shown as editable `# %% [type] cell:N` text; edits round-trip back to the underlying JSON preserving notebook metadata. Add `:raw` to a notebook to bypass the converter and read the JSON directly.

# Images

Reading an image path returns metadata (mime, bytes, dimensions, channels, alpha). For actual visual analysis, call `inspect_image` with the path and a question describing what to inspect.

# Archives

Supports `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, `.zip`. Use `archive.ext:path/inside/archive` to read a member, and append a normal selector to the inner path: `archive.zip:dir/file.ts:50-60`.

# SQLite

For `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`, `.db`, `.db3`:
- `file.db` — list tables with row counts
- `file.db:table` — schema + sample rows
- `file.db:table:key` — single row by primary key
- `file.db:table?limit=50&offset=100` — paginated rows
- `file.db:table?where=status='active'&order=created:desc` — filtered rows
- `file.db?q=SELECT …` — read-only SELECT query

# URLs

- Default reader-mode: HTML pages, GitHub issues/PRs, Stack Overflow, Wikipedia, Reddit, NPM, arXiv, RSS/Atom, JSON endpoints, PDFs → clean text/markdown.
- `:raw` returns untouched HTML; line selectors (`:50`, `:50-100`, `:50+150`) paginate the cached fetched output.
- Bare `host:port` URLs collide with the selector grammar — add a trailing slash before the selector: `https://example.com/:80`.

# Internal URIs

`skill://<name>`, `agent://<id>`, `artifact://<id>`, `memory://root`, `rule://<name>`, `local://<name>.md`, `vault://<vault>/<path>`, `mcp://<uri>` resolve transparently and accept the same line selectors as filesystem paths. Use `artifact://<id>` to recover full output that a previous bash/eval/tool result spilled or truncated.

<critical>
- You MUST use `read` for every file, directory, archive, and URL inspection. `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, `more`, `ls`, `tar`, `unzip`, `curl`, `wget` are FORBIDDEN — any such bash call is a bug, regardless of how short or convenient it looks.
- You MUST prefer `read` over a browser/puppeteer tool for URL content; only reach for a browser when `read` cannot deliver reasonable content.
- You MUST always include `path`. NEVER call `read` with `{}`.
- For line ranges, append the selector to `path` (`path="src/foo.ts:50-200"`, `path="src/foo.ts:50+150"`). NEVER substitute `sed -n`, `awk NR`, or `head`/`tail` pipelines.
- Summary footer says `read <path>:raw …`? Re-issue the exact selector it names. NEVER guess what's inside `..` / `…` markers — they carry no content.
- You MAY combine selectors with URL reads and internal URIs; both paginate the cached resolved output.
</critical>

Parameters:
	<parameter name="toJSONSchema">undefined</parameter>
	<parameter name="def">{"type":"object","shape":{"path":{"def":{"type":"string"},"type":"string","format":null,"minLength":null,"maxLength":null}},"catchall":{"def":{"type":"never"},"type":"never"}}</parameter>

	<parameter name="safeDecodeAsync">undefined</parameter>
</tool>

<tool name="edit">
Your patch language names lines to replace, delete, or insert at, then lists the new content. Rule of thumb: a header ending in `:` is followed by `+` body rows; `delete` has no body.

<headers>
Every file section starts with `¶PATH#TAG`. `TAG` is the 3-char snapshot tag from your latest `read`/`search`. REQUIRED for any hunk that names line numbers. Hashless `¶PATH` is allowed only for new-file creation or a patch that is purely `insert head:` / `insert tail:`.
</headers>

<ops>
replace N..M:      replace original lines N..M with the body rows below.
delete N..M        delete original lines N..M. No body.
insert before N:   insert the body rows immediately before line N.
insert after N:    insert the body rows immediately after line N.
insert head:       insert the body rows at the very start of the file.
insert tail:       insert the body rows at the very end of the file.
Single line: `replace N..N:` / `delete N`. The range is the ORIGINAL lines you touch; body length is irrelevant (replacing 1 line with 10 is still `replace N..N:`).
</ops>

<body-rows>
Body rows appear only under a `:` header. Every body row is:
  +TEXT     add a new literal line `TEXT`, verbatim (leading whitespace kept). `+` alone adds a blank line.
There is NO other body row kind. NEVER write `-old` or a bare/context line. To keep a line, leave it out of every range. To insert a literal line starting with `-` or `+`, prefix it: `+-x`, `++x`.
</body-rows>

<rules>
- Line numbers come from `read`/`search` (`LINE:TEXT`). Copy the `¶PATH#TAG` header; use the bare LINE numbers.
- Numbers refer to the ORIGINAL file and stay valid for the whole patch — they do not shift as hunks apply.
- One hunk per range; the body is the final content, never an old/new pair.
- To change lines 2 and 5 while keeping 3–4, issue two hunks (`replace 2..2:` and `replace 5..5:`). Untouched lines are simply absent from every range.
</rules>

<example>
Original (the exact shape `read` returns):
```
¶greet.py#A1
1:def greet(name):
2:    msg = "Hello, " + name
3:    print(msg)
4:greet("world")
```

Insert a guard after line 1:
```
¶greet.py#A1
insert after 1:
+    if not name: name = "stranger"
```

Replace line 2 with two lines:
```
¶greet.py#A1
replace 2..2:
+    greeting = "Hi"
+    msg = f"{greeting}, {name}"
```

Delete line 3:
```
¶greet.py#A1
delete 3
```

Add a header and trailer:
```
¶greet.py#A1
insert head:
+# generated header
insert tail:
+greet("everyone")
```
</example>

<anti-patterns>
# WRONG — empty `replace` to delete. RIGHT: delete 4
replace 4..4:

# WRONG — range describes post-edit size. RIGHT: replace 1..1: (body length is irrelevant)
replace 1..2:
+def greet(name):

# WRONG — `-` rows / bare context lines do not exist. The range deletes; the body is only the new content.
replace 3..3:
    msg = "Hello, " + name
-   print(msg)
+   return msg
# RIGHT
replace 3..3:
+   return msg

<thinking>
I need to look more carefully for a duplicated line with a subtle change. Let me search through the file. Maybe it's a line like:

`const noCI = $env.PI_BASH_NO_CI || $env.CLAUDE_BASH_NO_CI;`

Or maybe something else. Let me look at the sections I haven't read in detail, or maybe look for patterns. The task says "duplicated line contains a subtle literal/operator change". That means there's likely two lines right next to each other or near each other that look almost identical but one has a bug.

Let me re-read the whole file carefully to find any duplicate-looking lines. Maybe in `buildSpawnEnv` or `getShellArgs` or `getShellPrefix`.

Actually, I should look for lines that are duplicated. Let me read the whole file raw and scan it myself.

## Assistant

<thinking>
I need to find a duplicated line with a subtle literal/operator change. Let me look more carefully at the file. I read the whole file, but let me look at specific patterns.

In `buildSpawnEnv`:
```typescript
function buildSpawnEnv(shell: string): Record<string, string> {
  const noCI = $env.PI_BASH_NO_CI || $env.CLAUDE_BASH_NO_CI;
  return {
    ...Bun.env,
    SHELL: shell,
    GIT_EDITOR: 'true',
    GPG_TTY: 'not a tty',
    OMPCODE: '1',
    CLAUDECODE: '1',
    ...(noCI ? {} : { CI: 'true' }),
  };
}
```

Wait, OMPCODE and CLAUDECODE - both set to '1'. That's not a bug.

In `getShellConfig`:
```typescript
    const programFiles = Bun.env.ProgramFiles;
    if (programFiles) {
      paths.push(`${programFiles}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
    const programFilesX86 = Bun.env['ProgramFiles(x86)'];
    if (programFilesX86) {
      paths.push(`${programFilesX86}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
```
These are similar but not duplicates - they use different variables.

In `resolveBasicShell`:
```typescript
  for (const name of ['bash', 'bash.exe', 'sh', 'sh.exe']) {
    const resolved = Bun.which(name);
    if (resolved) return resolved;
  }
```

Wait, let me look again at `buildSpawnEnv`:
```typescript
    GIT_EDITOR: 'true',
    GPG_TTY: 'not a tty',
    OMPCODE: '1',
    CLAUDECODE: '1',
    ...(noCI ? {} : { CI: 'true' }),
```

Actually, looking at the `terminate` function:
```typescript
      if (exitPromise) {
        const exited = await Promise.race([Bun.sleep(1000).then(() => false), exitPromise]);
        if (exited) return true;
      }
```

And then later:
```typescript
    return await Promise.race([Bun.sleep(timeout).then(() => false), exitPromise]);
```

Those are similar but not duplicates.

Wait, let me look at the `getShellConfig` function more carefully. I see:
```typescript
    const paths: string[] = [];
    const programFiles = Bun.env.ProgramFiles;
    if (programFiles) {
      paths.push(`${programFiles}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
    const programFilesX86 = Bun.env['ProgramFiles(x86)'];
    if (programFilesX86) {
      paths.push(`${programFilesX86}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
```

Hmm, `programFiles` and `programFilesX86` - similar but not exactly duplicated.

Let me re-read the instructions: "A duplicated line contains a subtle literal/operator change." This means there should be two lines that are almost identical but one has a subtle bug. Maybe one is `OMPCODE: '1'` and another is `OMPCODE: '1'`? No, that's not it.

Wait, let me look at the `isPidRunning` function:
```typescript
export function isPidRunning(pid: number | Subprocess): boolean {
  try {
    if (typeof pid === 'number') {
      process.kill(pid, 0);
    } else {
      if (pid.killed) return true;
      if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;
    }
    return true;
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
}
```

Hmm, `if (pid.killed) return true;` - when a subprocess is killed, it should return false? Actually, no. The function is "isPidRunning". If killed is true, it's not running. So `return true` is wrong? But that's a semantic bug, not a duplicated line.

Let me look at the `resolveBasicShell` function again:
```typescript
  for (const name of ['bash', 'bash.exe', 'sh', 'sh.exe']) {
    const resolved = Bun.which(name);
    if (resolved) return resolved;
  }
```

Wait, I should look for actual duplicated lines. Maybe the file has a copy-paste error where a block was duplicated. Let me search using a tool for patterns, but I don't have grep. I can just read the file again and look very carefully.

Actually, I notice in `buildSpawnEnv`:
```typescript
    OMPCODE: '1',
    CLAUDECODE: '1',
```

Hmm, let me look at `getShellConfig` again:
```typescript
  // Unix: prefer user's shell from $SHELL if it's bash/zsh and executable
  const userShell = Bun.env.SHELL;
  const isValidShell = userShell && (userShell.includes('bash') || userShell.includes('zsh'));
  if (isValidShell && isExecutable(userShell)) {
    cachedShellConfig = buildConfig(userShell);
    return cachedShellConfig;
  }

  // 4. Fallback: use basic shell
  const basicShell = resolveBasicShell();
  if (basicShell) {
    cachedShellConfig = buildConfig(basicShell);
    return cachedShellConfig;
  }
  cachedShellConfig = buildConfig('sh');
  return cachedShellConfig;
```

Wait, I think I see something! In `getShellConfig` on Windows, there's:
```typescript
    const programFiles = Bun.env.ProgramFiles;
    if (programFiles) {
      paths.push(`${programFiles}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
    const programFilesX86 = Bun.env['ProgramFiles(x86)'];
    if (programFilesX86) {
      paths.push(`${programFilesX86}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
```

This is not a duplication.

Let me look at the `terminate` function. In the first try block:
```typescript
      if (typeof target === 'number') {
        process.kill(target, TERM_SIGNAL);
      } else {
        target.kill(TERM_SIGNAL);
      }
```

And in the second try block:
```typescript
      try {
        if (typeof target === 'number') {
          process.kill(target, 'SIGKILL');
        } else {
          target.kill('SIGKILL');
        }
      } catch {}
```

These are similar but not duplicated lines.

Wait, I think I found it! In `buildSpawnEnv`:
```typescript
    OMPCODE: '1',
    CLAUDECODE: '1',
    ...(noCI ? {} : { CI: 'true' }),
```

But what about:
```typescript
    GIT_EDITOR: 'true',
    GPG_TTY: 'not a tty',
```

Actually, I need to look more carefully. Let me look for the exact pattern. Maybe there's something like:

```typescript
  const noLogin = $env.PI_BASH_NO_LOGIN || $env.CLAUDE_BASH_NO_LOGIN;
  return noLogin ? ['-c'] : ['-l', '-c'];
```

And then elsewhere:
```typescript
  const noCI = $env.PI_BASH_NO_CI || $env.CLAUDE_BASH_NO_CI;
```

Hmm, `PI_BASH_NO_CI` and `CLAUDE_BASH_NO_CI` - these are different env vars.

Let me look at the `isPidRunning` function again. The line:
```typescript
      if (pid.killed) return true;
```

If `pid.killed` is true, the process is not running. But `isPidRunning` returns `true` when killed. That seems like a bug. But is it a duplicated line?

Actually, wait. I should look at the `terminate` function:
```typescript
    if (typeof target === 'number') {
      pid = target;
    } else {
      pid = target.pid;
      if (target.killed) return true;
    }
```

So in `terminate`, if `target.killed` is true, it returns true (meaning it considers it already terminated). In `isPidRunning`, if `pid.killed` is true, it returns true (meaning it considers it running). That's inconsistent.

But the task says "duplicated line". Let me look for an actual duplicated line. Maybe I need to search for it. Let me re-read the `getShellConfig` function carefully.

Actually, I just spotted it! In `buildSpawnEnv`:
```typescript
    GIT_EDITOR: 'true',
    GPG_TTY: 'not a tty',
    OMPCODE: '1',
    CLAUDECODE: '1',
    ...(noCI ? {} : { CI: 'true' }),
```

Wait, is `GIT_EDITOR: 'true'` duplicated somewhere? No.

Let me look at `resolveBasicShell`:
```typescript
    const searchPaths = ['/bin', '/usr/bin', '/usr/local/bin', '/opt/homebrew/bin'];
    const candidates = ['bash', 'sh'];

    for (const name of candidates) {
      for (const dir of searchPaths) {
        const fullPath = path.join(dir, name);
        if (fs.existsSync(fullPath)) return fullPath;
      }
    }
```

No duplication there.

Let me re-read the file from the top again, looking for two consecutive lines that are almost identical.

Top part:
```typescript
import * as fs from 'node:fs';
import path from 'node:path';
import * as timers from 'node:timers';
import type { Subprocess } from 'bun';
import { $env } from './env';
```

No.

`buildSpawnEnv`:
```typescript
function buildSpawnEnv(shell: string): Record<string, string> {
  const noCI = $env.PI_BASH_NO_CI || $env.CLAUDE_BASH_NO_CI;
  return {
    ...Bun.env,
    SHELL: shell,
    GIT_EDITOR: 'true',
    GPG_TTY: 'not a tty',
    OMPCODE: '1',
    CLAUDECODE: '1',
    ...(noCI ? {} : { CI: 'true' }),
  };
}
```

Wait! `OMPCODE: '1',` and `CLAUDECODE: '1',` are not duplicates.

Let me look at `getShellConfig`:
```typescript
  if (process.platform === 'win32') {
    // 2. Try Git Bash in known locations
    const paths: string[] = [];
    const programFiles = Bun.env.ProgramFiles;
    if (programFiles) {
      paths.push(`${programFiles}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
    const programFilesX86 = Bun.env['ProgramFiles(x86)'];
    if (programFilesX86) {
      paths.push(`${programFilesX86}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
```

Ah! Look at:
```typescript
    const programFiles = Bun.env.ProgramFiles;
    if (programFiles) {
      paths.push(`${programFiles}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
    const programFilesX86 = Bun.env['ProgramFiles(x86)'];
    if (programFilesX86) {
      paths.push(`${programFilesX86}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
```

Wait, is there a duplication here? No, these are two different variables.

Hmm, what about this:
```typescript
    const bashOnPath = findBashOnPath();
    if (bashOnPath) {
      cachedShellConfig = buildConfig(bashOnPath);
      return cachedShellConfig;
    }
```

And earlier:
```typescript
    for (const path of paths) {
      if (fs.existsSync(path)) {
        cachedShellConfig = buildConfig(path);
        return cachedShellConfig;
      }
    }
```

These are similar but not duplicates.

Let me look at the `terminate` function very carefully:
```typescript
    // Determine PID
    let pid: number | undefined;
    const exitPromise = onProcessExit(target, abortSignal);
    if (typeof target === 'number') {
      pid = target;
    } else {
      pid = target.pid;
      if (target.killed) return true;
    }
```

Wait, I see `pid = target.pid;` and `if (target.killed) return true;`. 

Hmm, let me look at `isPidRunning`:
```typescript
    } else {
      if (pid.killed) return true;
      if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;
    }
```

And in `terminate`:
```typescript
    } else {
      pid = target.pid;
      if (target.killed) return true;
    }
```

These are similar blocks but not duplicated lines.

Let me look at the `onProcessExit` function:
```typescript
  const timer = timers.promises.setInterval(300, null, {
    signal: joinSignals(abortSignal, localAbortController.signal),
  });
```

Wait, `setInterval(300, null, ...)` - that seems odd. The standard signature for `timers.promises.setInterval` is `(delay, value?, options?)`. But that's not a duplicate.

Let me try a different approach - maybe I should look for lines that are literally duplicated. I can read the file and look at line by line.

Actually, I think I found it! In `getShellConfig`:
```typescript
    const programFiles = Bun.env.ProgramFiles;
    if (programFiles) {
      paths.push(`${programFiles}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
    const programFilesX86 = Bun.env['ProgramFiles(x86)'];
    if (programFilesX86) {
      paths.push(`${programFilesX86}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
```

Wait, maybe the bug is somewhere else entirely. Let me look at the `isPidRunning` function again:
```typescript
    if (typeof pid === 'number') {
      process.kill(pid, 0);
    } else {
      if (pid.killed) return true;
      if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;
    }
```

`if (pid.killed) return true;` - if killed, it returns true, meaning it's running. That seems wrong. The correct behavior would be `return false;` if killed. But the task says "duplicated line contains a subtle literal/operator change". 

Hmm, maybe there's a line that was duplicated and one of them has a different operator? Let me think about what could be duplicated.

Actually, let me look at `buildSpawnEnv` more carefully:
```typescript
    OMPCODE: '1',
    CLAUDECODE: '1',
```

Wait, maybe one of them should be something else? The task says "duplicated line contains a subtle literal/operator change". If the line was duplicated, maybe we have:

```typescript
    OMPCODE: '1',
    OMPCODE: '1',
```

But one of them is subtly changed to `OMPCODE: '0'` or something? But I see `OMPCODE` and `CLAUDECODE` which are different keys.

Wait, let me look at `terminate` again. First block:
```typescript
      if (typeof target === 'number') {
        process.kill(target, TERM_SIGNAL);
      } else {
        target.kill(TERM_SIGNAL);
      }
```

Second block:
```typescript
        if (typeof target === 'number') {
          process.kill(target, 'SIGKILL');
        } else {
          target.kill('SIGKILL');
        }
```

Are these "duplicated lines"? The first uses `TERM_SIGNAL`, the second uses `'SIGKILL'`. But they are not adjacent.

Actually, maybe the bug is in `resolveBasicShell`:
```typescript
    const searchPaths = ['/bin', '/usr/bin', '/usr/local/bin', '/opt/homebrew/bin'];
    const candidates = ['bash', 'sh'];

    for (const name of candidates) {
      for (const dir of searchPaths) {
        const fullPath = path.join(dir, name);
        if (fs.existsSync(fullPath)) return fullPath;
      }
    }
```

Wait, I just realized something. In `isPidRunning`:
```typescript
      if (pid.killed) return true;
      if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;
```

If `killed` is true, it means the process has been killed. The function should return false because it's not running. But it returns true. This is the bug.

But the task says "duplicated line contains a subtle literal/operator change". Maybe `return true` is a duplicated line from somewhere else? Or maybe the original code had:

```typescript
      if (pid.killed) return false;
      if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;
```

And someone duplicated `return false` but changed it to `return true`? No, that doesn't make sense.

Let me look at this from a different angle. Maybe I should look for lines that are very similar. For example, in `getShellConfig`:

```typescript
  if (isValidShell && isExecutable(userShell)) {
    cachedShellConfig = buildConfig(userShell);
    return cachedShellConfig;
  }

  // 4. Fallback: use basic shell
  const basicShell = resolveBasicShell();
  if (basicShell) {
    cachedShellConfig = buildConfig(basicShell);
    return cachedShellConfig;
  }
  cachedShellConfig = buildConfig('sh');
  return cachedShellConfig;
```

Wait, `cachedShellConfig = buildConfig(userShell); return cachedShellConfig;` is duplicated three times. But that's by design.

Actually, I think I need to look at the file even more carefully. Let me look for something like `===` vs `!==` or `==` vs `!=`, or `'true'` vs `'false'`, or `0` vs `1`.

In `isPidRunning`:
```typescript
      if (pid.killed) return true;
      if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;
```

Hmm, `return true` when `killed` is true. In a boolean context, `killed` means the process was killed. For `isPidRunning`, if the process is killed, it should return false. The line `return true` is likely a bug where it should be `return false`.

But the task says "duplicated line". Maybe `return true` is a duplicate of `return true` from the catch block? The catch block also returns false.

Wait, I have an idea. Maybe the bug is not in `isPidRunning`. Let me look at the `terminate` function again:

```typescript
    if (typeof target === 'number') {
      pid = target;
    } else {
      pid = target.pid;
      if (target.killed) return true;
    }
```

`if (target.killed) return true;` - this is correct in the context of `terminate` because if it's already killed, we can return true (successfully terminated).

But in `isPidRunning`:
```typescript
      if (pid.killed) return true;
```

This is the same line but in a different context. The bug is that this line was duplicated from `terminate` but the logic is wrong for `isPidRunning`.

Actually, wait. The task says "A duplicated line contains a subtle literal/operator change." This could mean the line itself is duplicated and slightly modified. Or it could mean there are two lines that are duplicates of each other but with a subtle change.

Let me look at `joinSignals`:
```typescript
function joinSignals(...sigs: (AbortSignal | null | undefined)[]): AbortSignal | undefined {
  const nn = sigs.filter(Boolean) as AbortSignal[];
  if (nn.length === 0) return undefined;
  if (nn.length === 1) return nn[0];
  return AbortSignal.any(nn);
}
```

No duplication there.

Let me look at `onProcessExit`:
```typescript
  const { promise, resolve, reject } = Promise.withResolvers<boolean>();
  const localAbortController = new AbortController();

  const timer = timers.promises.setInterval(300, null, {
    signal: joinSignals(abortSignal, localAbortController.signal),
  });
```

Wait, `setInterval(300, null, ...)` - the `null` value is passed as the value for each interval tick. That's not a bug.

Let me look at `terminate` one more time. There's:
```typescript
    if (nativeKillTree) {
      nativeKillTree(pid, 9);
    } else {
      if (group && !IS_WINDOWS) {
        try {
          process.kill(-pid, 'SIGKILL');
        } catch {}
      }
      try {
        if (typeof target === 'number') {
          process.kill(target, 'SIGKILL');
        } else {
          target.kill('SIGKILL');
        }
      } catch {}
    }
```

Hmm, `process.kill(-pid, 'SIGKILL')` - the negative sign. But that's not a duplicate.

Wait, I think I found it! Let me look at `buildSpawnEnv`:
```typescript
    OMPCODE: '1',
    CLAUDECODE: '1',
```

And maybe somewhere else there's a duplicate? No.

Actually, let me look at the imports:
```typescript
import * as fs from 'node:fs';
import path from 'node:path';
import * as timers from 'node:timers';
```

And then:
```typescript
import { $env } from './env';
```

No duplication.

Let me look at `isPidRunning` again, but this time focusing on the exact wording:
```typescript
export function isPidRunning(pid: number | Subprocess): boolean {
  try {
    if (typeof pid === 'number') {
      process.kill(pid, 0);
    } else {
      if (pid.killed) return true;
      if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;
    }
    return true;
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
}
```

Wait, I think the bug is `if (pid.killed) return true;`. If `pid.killed` is true, the process is NOT running, so it should return `false`. But the line says `return true`. This is a clear bug.

But is it a "duplicated line"? Maybe the original code was `if (pid.killed) return false;` and someone duplicated it and changed it to `true`? Or maybe it's duplicated from `if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;` but with `true` instead of `false`?

Actually, I think the bug might be somewhere else. Let me search for `true` and `false` patterns.

In `buildSpawnEnv`:
```typescript
    GIT_EDITOR: 'true',
```

And `isExecutable`:
```typescript
  try {
    fs.accessSync(path, fs.constants.X_OK);
    return true;
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
```

Hmm, `return true` and `return false` are common.

Wait, I think I need to look at the `terminate` function. There's:
```typescript
      if (exitPromise) {
        const exited = await Promise.race([Bun.sleep(1000).then(() => false), exitPromise]);
        if (exited) return true;
      }
```

And then:
```typescript
    return await Promise.race([Bun.sleep(timeout).then(() => false), exitPromise]);
```

These are very similar but not duplicated.

Actually, I just realized something. Let me look at `isPidRunning` more carefully. The Subprocess type from bun has a `killed` property. When `killed` is true, it means the process has been killed. So `isPidRunning` should return false.

But is there a duplicated line? Let me look at the `onProcessExit` function:
```typescript
  if (typeof proc !== 'number') {
    return proc.exited.then(
      () => true,
      () => true,
    );
  }
```

And `isPidRunning`:
```typescript
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
```

Not duplicates.

Wait, maybe I should look at `resolveBasicShell` again:
```typescript
  for (const name of ['bash', 'bash.exe', 'sh', 'sh.exe']) {
    const resolved = Bun.which(name);
    if (resolved) return resolved;
  }
```

And `getShellConfig`:
```typescript
  for (const path of paths) {
      if (fs.existsSync(path)) {
        cachedShellConfig = buildConfig(path);
        return cachedShellConfig;
      }
    }
```

Hmm.

Actually, I think I found the bug! In `buildSpawnEnv`:
```typescript
    OMPCODE: '1',
    CLAUDECODE: '1',
```

Wait, what if `CLAUDECODE` should be `'0'` or something else? But the task says it's a duplicated line. Maybe the line `OMPCODE: '1',` was duplicated and `OMPCODE` was changed to `CLAUDECODE`? But both are '1', so that's not a bug.

Hmm, let me look at `getShellConfig` again. I see:
```typescript
  if (process.platform === 'win32') {
```

And then:
```typescript
  if (process.platform !== 'win32') {
```

In `resolveBasicShell`. That's not a duplication.

Wait, I think I see it! In `getShellConfig`:
```typescript
    const programFiles = Bun.env.ProgramFiles;
    if (programFiles) {
      paths.push(`${programFiles}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
    const programFilesX86 = Bun.env['ProgramFiles(x86)'];
    if (programFilesX86) {
      paths.push(`${programFilesX86}\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`);
    }
```

Wait, is there a duplicate of the `paths.push` line? Let me look at the file again.

Actually, I just realized I might be looking at this wrong. Maybe the bug is in `isPidRunning`:

```typescript
      if (pid.killed) return true;
      if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;
```

If `pid.killed` is true, return true. If `pid.exitCode !== null`, return false. These are two consecutive lines that are almost identical in structure but one has `true` and one has `false`. The bug is that `return true` should be `return false` because if the process is killed, it's not running.

This is the most likely candidate. The "duplicated line" refers to the pattern `if (pid.killed) return true;` being a duplicate of the pattern `if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;` but with a subtle change (`true` instead of `false`).

Actually, the task says "A duplicated line contains a subtle literal/operator change." This could mean a line was literally copy-pasted and one token was changed. The line `if (pid.killed) return true;` is suspicious because `return true` when `killed` is true makes no sense in `isPidRunning`.

Let me check if there's any other duplicated line. Maybe in `terminate`:

```typescript
      if (typeof target === 'number') {
        process.kill(target, TERM_SIGNAL);
      } else {
        target.kill(TERM_SIGNAL);
      }
```

And then:
```typescript
        if (typeof target === 'number') {
          process.kill(target, 'SIGKILL');
        } else {
          target.kill('SIGKILL');
        }
```

These are duplicated blocks with `TERM_SIGNAL` changed to `'SIGKILL'`. But `TERM_SIGNAL` is `SIGTERM` on Unix, so this is intentional - first a gentle kill, then a force kill.

Actually, wait. I see `process.kill(target, TERM_SIGNAL)` and `target.kill(TERM_SIGNAL)` in the first block, and `process.kill(target, 'SIGKILL')` and `target.kill('SIGKILL')` in the second block. The subtle change is in the signal argument. But that's not a bug.

Hmm, let me look at the `isPidRunning` function one more time. I think the bug is there.

Actually, I just spotted something. In `isPidRunning`:
```typescript
    if (typeof pid === 'number') {
      process.kill(pid, 0);
    } else {
      if (pid.killed) return true;
      if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;
    }
```

Wait, `if (pid.killed) return true;` - if a process is killed, it's not running. So `return true` is wrong. It should be `return false`.

But actually, I think there's another possibility. Let me look at `buildSpawnEnv`:
```typescript
  const noCI = $env.PI_BASH_NO_CI || $env.CLAUDE_BASH_NO_CI;
  return {
    ...Bun.env,
    SHELL: shell,
    GIT_EDITOR: 'true',
    GPG_TTY: 'not a tty',
    OMPCODE: '1',
    CLAUDECODE: '1',
    ...(noCI ? {} : { CI: 'true' }),
  };
```

`OMPCODE: '1'` and `CLAUDECODE: '1'` - these are not duplicated lines.

Wait, what about `GPG_TTY: 'not a tty'`? Is that duplicated somewhere? No.

Actually, let me look at the `terminate` function:
```typescript
    if (nativeKillTree) {
      nativeKillTree(pid, 9);
    } else {
      if (group && !IS_WINDOWS) {
        try {
          process.kill(-pid, 'SIGKILL');
        } catch {}
      }
      try {
        if (typeof target === 'number') {
          process.kill(target, 'SIGKILL');
        } else {
          target.kill('SIGKILL');
        }
      } catch {}
    }
```

Wait, `nativeKillTree(pid, 9);` - `9` is the signal number for SIGKILL. But `nativeKillTree` takes `(pid, signal)` and returns the number of processes killed. The signal `9` is correct.

But look at `process.kill(-pid, 'SIGKILL')` - the negative pid means kill the process group. And then `process.kill(target, 'SIGKILL')` - the non-negative pid. This is correct.

Hmm, let me look at `isExecutable`:
```typescript
function isExecutable(path: string): boolean {
  try {
    fs.accessSync(path, fs.constants.X_OK);
    return true;
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
}
```

No duplication there.

I think I need to look at the `isPidRunning` function and the bug is `if (pid.killed) return true;`. The `return true` is wrong because if the process is killed, it's not running. The correct value should be `return false`.

But wait - is there a subtle literal/operator change? Let me look at `isPidRunning` again:
```typescript
    } else {
      if (pid.killed) return true;
      if (pid.exitCode !== null) return false;
    }
```

Actually, maybe `return true` was duplicated from `return true` in the `typeof pid === 'number'` branch? In that branch, `process.kill(pid, 0)` throws if the process doesn't exist, so `return true` is correct after it. The `else` branch checks `pid.killed` and `pid.exitCode`. The `return true` for `pid.killed` is wrong.

Actually, I think the bug is `if (pid.killed) return true;`. If `pid.killed` is true, it means the process has been killed, so it should return `false`. The subtle change is the literal `true` instead of `false`.

Let me verify this is the only bug by looking at the file once more.

Wait, I should also check if maybe there's a bug in `resolveBasicShell`:
```typescript
  for (const name of ['bash', 'bash.exe', 'sh', 'sh.exe']) {
    const resolved = Bun.which(name);
    if (resolved) return resolved;
  }
```

No bug there.

Or in `getShellConfig`:
```typescript
  // Unix: prefer user's shell from $SHELL if it's bash/zsh and executable
  const userShell = Bun.env.SHELL;
  const isValidShell = userShell && (userShell.includes('bash') || userShell.includes('zsh'));
  if (isValidShell && isExecutable(userShell)) {
    cachedShellConfig = buildConfig(userShell);
    return cachedShellConfig;
  }
```

No bug.

What about `getShellArgs`:
```typescript
function getShellArgs(): string[] {
  const noLogin = $env.PI_BASH_NO_LOGIN || $env.CLAUDE_BASH_NO_LOGIN;
  return noLogin ? ['-c'] : ['-l', '-c'];
}
```

No bug.

I think the bug is definitely in `isPidRunning` at line 229:
```typescript
      if (pid.killed) return true;
```

This should be `return false` because a killed process is not running.

Wait, but let me think about whether `pid.killed` in Bun means "the process has been killed" or "the kill method was called". In Bun's `Subprocess`, `killed` is a boolean that indicates whether the process has been killed. If it's true, the process is no longer running. So `isPidRunning` should return `false`.

I'll fix this by changing `return true` to `return false` on line 229.
