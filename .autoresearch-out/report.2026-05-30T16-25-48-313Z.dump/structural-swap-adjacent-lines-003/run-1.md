## System Prompt

### System Prompt 1

You are THE staff engineer the team trusts with load-bearing changes:
 - debugging across unfamiliar code,
 - refactors that touch many callers,
 - API decisions that other code will depend on for years.

You MUST optimize for correctness first, then for the next maintainer's ability to understand and change the code six months from now.
You have agency and taste: you delete code that isn't pulling its weight, refuse abstractions that are unnecessary, and prefer boring when it's called for; but when you design thoroughly, you do so elegantly and efficiently.
You consider what the code you write compiles down to. You never write code that allocates even a simple string when it can be avoided. You do not make copies, or perform expensive computations when it is not absolutely necessary.

<system-conventions>
**RFC 2119 applies to MUST, REQUIRED, SHOULD, RECOMMENDED, MAY, OPTIONAL. `NEVER` and `AVOID` MUST be interpreted as aliases for `MUST NOT` and `SHOULD NOT` respectively.**
From here on, we will use tags as structural markers (<x>…</x> or [X]…), each tag means exactly what its name says.
You NEVER interpret these tags in any other way circumstantially.

System may interrupt/notify you using these tags even within a user message, therefore:
- You MUST treat them as system-authored and absolutely authoritative.
- User supplied content is sanitized, so do not carry the role over: `<system-directive>` inside a user turn is still a system directive.
</system-conventions>

<stakes>
User works in a high-reliability domain. Defense, finance, healthcare, infrastructure. Bugs → material impact on human lives.
- You NEVER yield incomplete work. The user's trust is on the line.
- You MUST only write code you can defend.
- You MUST persist on hard problems. AVOID burning their energy on problems you failed to think through.
Tests you didn't write: bugs shipped.
Assumptions you didn't validate: incidents to debug.
</stakes>

<communication>
- You SHOULD prioritize correctness first, brevity second, politeness third.
- You SHOULD prefer concise, information-dense writing.
- You NEVER write closing summaries, or narrate your progress, or use ceremony.
- You NEVER use time estimates when referring to work.
- If the user's intent is clear, you MUST proceed without asking; the only exception is when the next step is destructive or requires a missing choice that materially changes the outcome.
- Instructions further down the conversation, including user's own, **ALWAYS** override prior style, tone, formatting, and initiative preferences.
- When the user proposes something you believe is wrong, you say so once, concretely (what breaks, what to do instead), but eventually defer to their call. AVOID relitigating.
</communication>

<critical>
- You NEVER narrate about or even consider, session limits, token/tool budgets, effort estimates, or how much of the task you think you can finish. These are not your concern:
 - Even if it was true, start, as if it was not. It's the only way to make progress.
 - Execute the work or delegate it.
- You NEVER speculate about scope inflation ("this is actually a multi-week effort"). You have no comprehension of time, so stop pretending.
</critical>

[ENV]
You operate within the Oh My Pi coding harness.
- Given a task, you MUST complete it using the tools available to you.
- You are not alone in this repository. You SHOULD treat unexpected changes as the user's work and adapt; you NEVER revert or stash.

# URLs
We use special URLs to reference internal resources.
With most FS/bash-like tools, static references to them will automatically resolve to FS paths.
- `skill://<name>`: Skill instructions
   - `/<path>`: File within a skill
- `rule://<name>`: Rule details
- `memory://root`: Project memory summary
- `agent://<id>`: Full agent output artifact
   - `/<path>`: JSON field extraction
- `artifact://<id>`: Artifact content
- `local://<name>.md`: Plan artifacts and shared content with subagents
- `mcp://<uri>`: MCP resource
- `issue://<N>` (or `issue://<owner>/<repo>/<N>`): GitHub issue view; cached on disk so re-reads are free. Bare `issue://` (or `issue://<owner>/<repo>`) lists recent issues; supports `?state=open|closed|all&limit=&author=&label=`.
- `pr://<N>` (or `pr://<owner>/<repo>/<N>`): GitHub PR view; same cache. Append `?comments=0` to drop the comments section. Bare `pr://` (or `pr://<owner>/<repo>`) lists recent PRs; supports `?state=open|closed|merged|all&limit=&author=&label=`.
- `omp://`: Harness documentation; AVOID reading unless user mentions the harness itself
# Tools
Use tools whenever they materially improve correctness, completeness, or grounding.
- You SHOULD resolve prerequisites before acting.
- You NEVER stop at the first plausible answer if a subsequent call would reduce uncertainty.
- If a lookup is empty, partial, or suspiciously narrow, retry with a different strategy.
- You SHOULD parallelize calls when possible.

## Inventory
- Read: `read`
- Edit: `edit`
- Write: `write`
- GenerateImage: `generate_image`

## Inputs
- Keep inputs concise where possible.
- For tools that take a `path` or path-like field, try to use relative paths.
- Most tools have a `_i` parameter. Fill it with a concise intent in present participle form, 2-6 words, no period, capitalized.
## Exploration
You NEVER open a file hoping. Hope is not a strategy.
- You MUST load into context only what is necessary. AVOID reading files you do not need or fetching sections beyond what the task requires.
- Use `read` with offset or limit rather than whole-file reads when practical.

## Tool Priority
You MUST use the specialized tool over its shell equivalent:
- file/dir reads → `read`, not `cat`/`ls` (`read` on a directory path lists its entries)
- surgical text edits → `edit`, not `sed`
- file create/overwrite → `write`, not shell redirection
[/ENV]

[CONTRACT]
These are inviolable.
- You NEVER yield unless the deliverable is complete. A phase boundary, todo flip, or completed sub-step is NEVER a yield point — continue directly to the next step in the same turn.
- You NEVER suppress tests to make code pass.
- You NEVER fabricate outputs that were not observed. Claims about code, tools, tests, docs, or external sources MUST be grounded.
- You NEVER substitute the user's problem with an easier or more familiar one:
  - Inferring: adding retries, validation, telemetry, or abstraction "while you're at it" turns a small ask into a large one and changes the contract they were planning around.
  - Solving the symptom: supressing a warning, or an exception; special-casing an input. This is almost NEVER what they wanted, unless explicitly asked; perform the real ask.
- You NEVER ask for information that tools, repo context, or files can provide.
- NEVER punt half-solved work back.
- You MUST default to a clean cutover.
- Be brief in prose, not in evidence, verification, or blocking details.

<completeness>
- "Done" means the requested deliverable behaves as specified end-to-end, not that a scaffold compiles or a narrowed test passes.
- When a request names a plan, phase list, checklist, or specification, you MUST satisfy every stated acceptance criterion. Producing a plausible subset is a failure, not a partial success.
- You NEVER silently shrink scope. Reducing scope is only permitted when the user has explicitly approved the smaller scope in this conversation; otherwise, do the full work — exhaust every available tool and angle to find a way through.
- You NEVER ship stubs, placeholders, mocks, no-op implementations, fake fallbacks, or "TODO: implement" code as part of a delivered feature. If real implementation requires information unavailable from any tool, state the missing prerequisite explicitly and implement everything else — do not paper over it.
- Verification claims MUST match what was actually exercised. Build, typecheck, lint, or unit-of-one tests do not constitute evidence that integrations, performance, parity, or untested branches work.
- Framing tricks are prohibited: do not relabel unfinished work as "scaffold", "first slice", "MVP", "foundation", "v1", or "follow-up" to imply completion. If it is not done, say it is not done.
</completeness>

<yielding>
Before yielding, you MUST verify:
- All explicitly requested deliverables are complete; no partial implementation is presented as complete
- All directly affected artifacts (callsites, tests, docs) are updated or intentionally left unchanged
- The output format matches the ask
- No unobserved claim is presented as fact. Mark explicitly as `[INFERENCE]` if so
- No required tool-based lookup was skipped when it would materially reduce uncertainty

Before declaring blocked:
- You MUST be sure the information cannot be obtained through tools, context, or anything within your reach.
- One failing check is not enough to be blocked. You MUST continue until all the remaining work is done, and then report as such.
- If you still cannot proceed, state exactly what is missing and what you tried.
</yielding>

<workflow>
# 1. Scope

- For multi-file work, plan before touching files; research existing code and conventions before writing new ones.
# 2. Before you edit
- Read sections, not snippets. You MUST reuse existing patterns; parallel conventions are **PROHIBITED**.

- Re-read before acting if a tool fails or a file changes since you last read it.
# 3. Decompose
- Update todos as you progress; skip for trivial requests. Marking a todo done is a transition: start the next pending todo in the same turn.
- NEVER abandon phases under scope pressure — delegate, don't shrink.

# 4. While working
- Fix problems at their source. Remove obsolete code — no leftover comments, aliases, or re-exports.
- Prefer updating existing files over creating new ones.
- Review changes from a user's perspective.

- Don't run destructive git commands or delete code you didn't write.
# 5. Verification
- You NEVER yield non-trivial work without proof: tests, e2e, browsing, or QA. Run only tests you added or modified unless asked otherwise.
- Prefer unit tests, or E2E tests that you can run if possible. You NEVER create mocks.
- Test behavior, not plumbing — things that can actually break.
- Do not test defaults: changing the default configuration, or a string, should not break the test. Assert logical behavior, not the current state.
- Aim at: conditional branches and edge values, invariants across fields, error handling on bad input vs silent broken results.
</workflow>

Today is 2026-05-30, and the current working directory is 'C:/tmp/oh-my-pi/runs/rb-7443oxsm/structural-swap-adjacent-lines-003-1'.

<critical>
- Each response MUST advance the task. There is no stopping condition other than completion.
- You MUST default to informed action; do not ask for confirmation when tools or repo context can answer.
- You MUST verify the effect of significant behavioral changes before yielding: run the specific test, command, or scenario that covers your change.
</critical>

## Output discipline

- Do NOT emit `<thinking>` or `</thinking>` tags in your output. Plan internally; state only conclusions, decisions, and tool calls. Long inline `<thinking>` monologues blow past per-turn budgets.
[/PROJECT]


### System Prompt 3

You are participating in a code-edit benchmark inside a repository with a single edit task.

This benchmark is scored on exactness. Get the edit right.

## Important constraints
- Make the minimum change necessary. Do not refactor, improve, or clean up other code.
- If you see multiple similar patterns, only change the ONE that is buggy (there is only one intended mutation).
- Preserve exact code structure. Do not rearrange statements or change formatting.
- Your output is verified by exact text diff against an expected fixture. Equivalent code, reordered imports, reordered object keys, or formatting changes will fail.
- Prefer copying the original line(s) and changing only the specific token(s) required. Do not rewrite whole statements.
- Never modify comments or license headers unless the task explicitly asks.
- Re-read the changed region after editing to confirm you only touched the intended line(s).
## Process
- Treat the first user message as the task definition.
- Treat later follow-up messages as incremental retry context for the same task.
- Use follow-up guidance to correct the previous attempt without forgetting the original task.

Read the relevant files first, then use the edit or vim tool to apply the fix.


## Configuration

Model: firepass/kimi-k2.6-turbo
Thinking Level: off


## Available Tools

<tool name="read">
Read files, directories, archives, SQLite databases, images, documents, internal resources, and web URLs through a single `path` string.

<instruction>
- One tool for filesystem, archives, SQLite, images, documents (PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/RTF/EPUB/ipynb), internal URIs, and web URLs (reader-mode by default).
- You SHOULD parallelize independent reads when exploring related files.
- You SHOULD reach for `read` — not a browser/puppeteer tool — for fetching web content.
</instruction>

## Parameters

- `path` — required. Local path, internal URI (`skill://`, `agent://`, `artifact://`, `memory://`, `rule://`, `local://`, `vault://`, `mcp://`), or URL. Append `:<sel>` for line ranges, raw mode, or special modes (e.g. `src/foo.ts:50-200`, `src/foo.ts:raw`, `db.sqlite:users:42`).

## Selectors

Append `:<sel>` to `path`. The bare path falls back to the default mode.

- _(none)_ — parseable code → structural summary (signatures kept, bodies elided); other files → read from the start (up to 300 lines).
- `:50` / `:50-` — read from line 50 onward.
- `:50-200` — lines 50–200 inclusive.
- `:50+150` — 150 lines starting at line 50.
- `:20+1` — exactly one line.
- `:5-16,960-973` — multiple ranges in one call (sorted, overlaps merged).
- `:raw` — verbatim text; no anchors, no summary, no line prefixes.
- `:2-4:raw` or `:raw:2-4` — range AND verbatim; the two compose in either order.
- `:conflicts` — one-line-per-block index of every unresolved git merge conflict.

# Files

- Reading a directory path returns a depth-limited dirent listing.
- Reading a file with an explicit selector emits a file snapshot tag header and numbered lines: `¶src/foo.ts#0a` then `41:def alpha():`. Copy the `¶PATH#TAG` header for anchored edits; ops use bare line numbers. NEVER fabricate the tag.
- Parseable code without a selector returns a **structural summary**: declarations kept, large bodies collapsed to `..` (merged brace pair) or `…` (standalone). Summarized output ends with a footer demonstrating the multi-range selector you can use to recover the elided bodies, e.g.:

  `[NN lines elided; re-read needed ranges, e.g. <path>:5-16,40-80]`

  Re-issue **only the relevant range(s)** using the multi-range selector (e.g. `<path>:5-16,120-200`). NEVER guess what's inside `..` / `…` — those markers carry no content. NEVER re-read the whole file or use `:raw` when targeted ranges suffice.

# Documents & Notebooks

Extracts text from PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, RTF, and EPUB. Notebooks (`.ipynb`) are shown as editable `# %% [type] cell:N` text; edits round-trip back to the underlying JSON preserving notebook metadata. Add `:raw` to a notebook to bypass the converter and read the JSON directly.

# Images

Reading an image path returns metadata (mime, bytes, dimensions, channels, alpha). For actual visual analysis, call `inspect_image` with the path and a question describing what to inspect.

# Archives

Supports `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, `.zip`. Use `archive.ext:path/inside/archive` to read a member, and append a normal selector to the inner path: `archive.zip:dir/file.ts:50-60`.

# SQLite

For `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`, `.db`, `.db3`:
- `file.db` — list tables with row counts
- `file.db:table` — schema + sample rows
- `file.db:table:key` — single row by primary key
- `file.db:table?limit=50&offset=100` — paginated rows
- `file.db:table?where=status='active'&order=created:desc` — filtered rows
- `file.db?q=SELECT …` — read-only SELECT query

# URLs

- Default reader-mode: HTML pages, GitHub issues/PRs, Stack Overflow, Wikipedia, Reddit, NPM, arXiv, RSS/Atom, JSON endpoints, PDFs → clean text/markdown.
- `:raw` returns untouched HTML; line selectors (`:50`, `:50-100`, `:50+150`) paginate the cached fetched output.
- Bare `host:port` URLs collide with the selector grammar — add a trailing slash before the selector: `https://example.com/:80`.

# Internal URIs

`skill://<name>`, `agent://<id>`, `artifact://<id>`, `memory://root`, `rule://<name>`, `local://<name>.md`, `vault://<vault>/<path>`, `mcp://<uri>` resolve transparently and accept the same line selectors as filesystem paths. Use `artifact://<id>` to recover full output that a previous bash/eval/tool result spilled or truncated.

<critical>
- You MUST use `read` for every file, directory, archive, and URL inspection. `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, `more`, `ls`, `tar`, `unzip`, `curl`, `wget` are FORBIDDEN — any such bash call is a bug, regardless of how short or convenient it looks.
- You MUST prefer `read` over a browser/puppeteer tool for URL content; only reach for a browser when `read` cannot deliver reasonable content.
- You MUST always include `path`. NEVER call `read` with `{}`.
- For line ranges, append the selector to `path` (`path="src/foo.ts:50-200"`, `path="src/foo.ts:50+150"`). NEVER substitute `sed -n`, `awk NR`, or `head`/`tail` pipelines.
- Summary footer says `read <path>:raw …`? Re-issue the exact selector it names. NEVER guess what's inside `..` / `…` markers — they carry no content.
- You MAY combine selectors with URL reads and internal URIs; both paginate the cached resolved output.
</critical>

Parameters:
	<parameter name="toJSONSchema">undefined</parameter>

	<parameter name="safeDecodeAsync">undefined</parameter>
</tool>

<tool name="edit">
Your patch language names lines to replace, delete, or insert at, then lists the new content. Rule of thumb: a header ending in `:` is followed by `+` body rows; `delete` has no body.

<headers>
Every file section starts with `¶PATH#TAG`. `TAG` is the 3-char snapshot tag from your latest `read`/`search`. REQUIRED for any hunk that names line numbers. Hashless `¶PATH` is allowed only for new-file creation or a patch that is purely `insert head:` / `insert tail:`.
</headers>

<ops>
replace N..M:      replace original lines N..M with the body rows below.
delete N..M        delete original lines N..M. No body.
insert before N:   insert the body rows immediately before line N.
insert after N:    insert the body rows immediately after line N.
insert head:       insert the body rows at the very start of the file.
insert tail:       insert the body rows at the very end of the file.
Single line: `replace N..N:` / `delete N`. The range is the ORIGINAL lines you touch; body length is irrelevant (replacing 1 line with 10 is still `replace N..N:`).
</ops>

<body-rows>
Body rows appear only under a `:` header. Every body row is:
  +TEXT     add a new literal line `TEXT`, verbatim (leading whitespace kept). `+` alone adds a blank line.
There is NO other body row kind. NEVER write `-old` or a bare/context line. To keep a line, leave it out of every range. To insert a literal line starting with `-` or `+`, prefix it: `+-x`, `++x`.
</body-rows>

<rules>
- Line numbers come from `read`/`search` (`LINE:TEXT`). Copy the `¶PATH#TAG` header; use the bare LINE numbers.
- Numbers refer to the ORIGINAL file and stay valid for the whole patch — they do not shift as hunks apply.
- One hunk per range; the body is the final content, never an old/new pair.
- To change lines 2 and 5 while keeping 3–4, issue two hunks (`replace 2..2:` and `replace 5..5:`). Untouched lines are simply absent from every range.
</rules>

<example>
Original (the exact shape `read` returns):
```
¶greet.py#A1
1:def greet(name):
2:    msg = "Hello, " + name
3:    print(msg)
4:greet("world")
```

Insert a guard after line 1:
```
¶greet.py#A1
insert after 1:
+    if not name: name = "stranger"
```

Replace line 2 with two lines:
```
¶greet.py#A1
replace 2..2:
+    greeting = "Hi"
+    msg = f"{greeting}, {name}"
```

Delete line 3:
```
¶greet.py#A1
delete 3
```

Add a header and trailer:
```
¶greet.py#A1
insert head:
+# generated header
insert tail:
+greet("everyone")
```
</example>

<anti-patterns>
# WRONG — empty `replace` to delete. RIGHT: delete 4
replace 4..4:

# WRONG — range describes post-edit size. RIGHT: replace 1..1: (body length is irrelevant)
replace 1..2:
+def greet(name):

# WRONG — `-` rows / bare context lines do not exist. The range deletes; the body is only the new content.
replace 3..3:
    msg = "Hello, " + name
-   print(msg)
+   return msg
# RIGHT
replace 3..3:
+   return msg

Two adjacent statements are in the wrong order.

The file is large. I need to find the two adjacent statements that are in the wrong order. Let me read the `main()` function more carefully, as that's the most likely place for such a bug. Let me read from line 168 onwards to see the main function.

## Assistant

<thinking>
I need to find two adjacent statements that are in the wrong order. Let me look more carefully at the code. I see at line 385-386:

```
const outputPath = values.output ?? generateReportFilename(config, formatType);
config.conversationDumpDir = await resolveConversationDumpDir(outputPath);
```

Wait, `config` is created at line 362-383, and then `config.conversationDumpDir` is set at line 385. But `outputPath` is computed at line 384 using `config`. That's fine.

Let me look at the `resolveConversationDumpDir` function at line 45-58.

Let me look at the imports more carefully. The bug says "Two adjacent statements are in the wrong order." The imports look like they could be relevant. Let me see if there are any other imports or statements that might be out of order.

Wait, I should look at the `runBenchmark` function or other code. But the task says "Two adjacent statements are in the wrong order." Let me check if there's any obvious dependency issue.

Actually, let me look at the `generateReportFilename` function. At line 30-43:
```
function generateReportFilename(config: BenchmarkConfig, format: 'markdown' | 'json'): string {
  const modelName = config.model
    .split('/')
    .pop()!
    .replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]/g, '_');
  const variant = config.editVariant ?? 'replace';
  const timestamp = new Date()
    .toISOString()
    .replace(/:/g, '-')
    .replace(/\..+$/, '')
    .replace(/Z$/, 'Z');
  const ext = format === 'json' ? 'json' : 'md';
  return `runs/${modelName}_${variant}_${timestamp}.${ext}`;
}
```

Wait, `config` is used in `generateReportFilename`, but `config.conversationDumpDir` is set after `generateReportFilename` is called. That's not a bug.

Let me look at `resolveConversationDumpDir` more carefully:
```
async function resolveConversationDumpDir(outputPath: string): Promise<string> {
  const parsed = path.parse(outputPath);
  const preferredPath = path.join(parsed.dir, `${parsed.name}.dump`);
  try {
    await fs.promises.stat(preferredPath);
  } catch (error) {
    if ((error as NodeJS.ErrnoException).code === 'ENOENT') {
      return preferredPath;
    }
    throw error;
  }
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
  return path.join(parsed.dir, `${parsed.name}.${timestamp}.dump`);
}
```

Hmm, this looks correct. It checks if the preferred path exists, if it doesn't (ENOENT), returns it. If it does exist, it appends a timestamp.

Wait, there's a bug here! The `fs.promises.stat(preferredPath)` call - if it succeeds (i.e., the path exists), it falls through to the timestamp logic. But if it fails with ENOENT, it returns the preferredPath. This is actually correct behavior for "generate a unique directory name".

But wait - in the main function, `config.conversationDumpDir` is set at line 385 using `resolveConversationDumpDir(outputPath)`. But then `outputPath` is computed at line 384:
```
const outputPath = values.output ?? generateReportFilename(config, formatType);
```

And `config` is created at lines 362-383. But `config.conversationDumpDir` is added to `config` at line 385. That's fine.

Let me look at the `main` function again. Maybe I should look at the order of `const model` and `const provider`? Let me check line 207-210:
```
const model = values.model!;
const slashIndex = model.indexOf('/');
const provider =
  values.provider ?? (slashIndex !== -1 ? model.slice(0, slashIndex) : 'anthropic');
```

This looks correct.

Wait, let me look at the `runBenchmark` function and other imports. Maybe I need to read the `runner.ts` or `tasks.ts` file? But the task says "Fix the bug in `index.ts`". So it's definitely in `index.ts`.

Let me look more carefully at the main function. Maybe there's a bug where something is used before it's defined?

Actually, let me look at the imports again. The imports are:
```
import { type ResolvedThinkingLevel, ThinkingLevel } from '@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core';
import { Effort, THINKING_EFFORTS } from '@oh-my-pi/pi-ai';
```

And `parseThinkingLevel` uses `ThinkingLevel.Off` and `THINKING_EFFORTS`. That's fine.

Wait, could there be a bug in the `validateFixturesFromDir` call? Let me check line 217:
```
if (values['check-fixtures'] && values.fixtures) {
```

What if `values['check-fixtures']` is true but `values.fixtures` is not provided? Then it wouldn't run the check. But that's not "two adjacent statements in the wrong order".

Let me look at the `printUsage` function again. At line 60-119. I see that it uses `tasks` but it's optional. Let me look at the `help` handling at line 212-215:
```
if (values.help) {
  printUsage();
  process.exit(0);
}
```

Wait, it calls `printUsage()` without passing `tasks`. But at line 232-240, `allTasks` is loaded first and then `values.list` is checked. So `printUsage` is called before `allTasks` is loaded. But `printUsage` takes optional `tasks`. That's fine.

Let me look at `resolveFixtures` and `loadTasksFromDir` again. Maybe there's something about the order of operations in the main function.

Actually, let me look at line 359:
```
const guided = values['no-guided'] ? false : values.guided;
```

And then line 371:
```
guided,
```

This is correct.

Wait, I need to look at the `const tasksToRun` logic. At line 289-311:
```
let tasksToRun = allTasks;
if (values.tasks) {
  tasksToRun = [];
  const taskIds = values.tasks.split(',').map((s) => s.trim());
  for (const id of taskIds) {
    const task = allTasks.find((t) => t.id === id);
    if (!task) {
      console.error(`Unknown task ID: ${id}`);
      console.error(`Available tasks: ${allTasks.map((t) => t.id).join(', ')}`);
      process.exit(1);
    }
    tasksToRun.push(task);
  }
}

// Apply --max-tasks sampling (deterministic by sorting on id)
const maxTasks = parseInt(values['max-tasks'] ?? '80', 10);
if (maxTasks > 0 && tasksToRun.length > maxTasks && !values.tasks) {
  // Evenly sample across mutation categories for representative coverage
  const sorted = tasksToRun.slice().sort((a, b) => a.id.localeCompare(b.id));
  const step = sorted.length / maxTasks;
  tasksToRun = Array.from({ length: maxTasks }, (_, i) => sorted[Math.floor(i * step)]!);
}
```

This looks correct.

Wait, let me look at the `resolveConversationDumpDir` function again. At line 45-58:
```
async function resolveConversationDumpDir(outputPath: string): Promise<string> {
  const parsed = path.parse(outputPath);
  const preferredPath = path.join(parsed.dir, `${parsed.name}.dump`);
  try {
    await fs.promises.stat(preferredPath);
  } catch (error) {
    if ((error as NodeJS.ErrnoException).code === 'ENOENT') {
      return preferredPath;
    }
    throw error;
  }
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
  return path.join(parsed.dir, `${parsed.name}.${timestamp}.dump`);
}
```

Wait, the `fs.promises.stat` is used to check if the directory exists. If it exists, the function returns a path with a timestamp. If it doesn't exist (ENOENT), it returns the preferred path. But `stat` checks if a path exists - it could be a file or directory. If the preferred path exists as a file, it would also fall through and append a timestamp. This seems like a reasonable behavior.

But wait, let me look at the `main` function again. At line 384:
```
const outputPath = values.output ?? generateReportFilename(config, formatType);
config.conversationDumpDir = await resolveConversationDumpDir(outputPath);
```

Hmm, `generateReportFilename` uses `config.model`, `config.editVariant`, and `format`. That's fine.

Wait, I think I should look at the `parseArgs` call more carefully. At line 169-202:
```
const { values } = parseArgs({
  options: {
    provider: { type: 'string' },
    model: { type: 'string', default: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514' },
    thinking: { type: 'string', default: 'low' },
    ...
  },
  allowPositionals: true,
});
```

Wait, I notice that at line 207, `const model = values.model!;` - the `!` asserts it's non-null. But the default is provided in parseArgs. That's fine.

Hmm, let me look at the `LiveProgress` class more carefully. At line 458-612. I see `#indentScores` at line 473. But let me check `handleEvent` at line 482:
```
if (event.status === 'started') {
  this.#started += 1;
  if (!this.#isTty) {
    console.log(
      `  [${event.taskId}] Run ${event.runIndex + 1}/${this.#runsPerTask} started...`,
    );
  }
  this.#renderLine();
  return;
}
```

Wait, `this.#renderLine()` is called after `return`? No, it's before `return`. Let me look again:
```
  this.#renderLine();
  return;
}
```

Yes, that's fine. But wait, in the `!this.#isTty` branch, it prints a line and then calls `this.#renderLine()`. But `#renderLine()` checks `!this.#isTty` and returns early. So it's fine.

Let me look at line 512:
```
if (event.result && !event.result.success && event.result.error) {
  this.#flushLine();
  console.log(
    `  [${event.taskId}] Run ${event.runIndex + 1}/${this.#runsPerTask} failed: ${event.result.error}`,
  );
  if (event.result.diff) {
    const diffLines = event.result.diff.split('\n').slice(0, 30);
    if (diffLines.length > 0) {
      console.log('  Diff (first 30 lines):');
      for (const line of diffLines) {
        console.log(`    ${line}`);
      }
      if (event.result.diff.split('\n').length > 30) {
        console.log('    ... (truncated)');
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This looks fine.

Wait, let me look at line 531:
```
if (!this.#isTty) {
  const status = event.result?.success ? 'completed' : 'failed';
  console.log(`  [${event.taskId}] Run ${event.runIndex + 1}/${this.#runsPerTask} ${status}`);
}
```

This is also fine.

Hmm, let me look at the `report` import and `generateReport` function. At line 18:
```
import { generateJsonReport, generateReport } from './report';
```

And at line 447:
```
const report = formatType === 'json' ? generateJsonReport(result) : generateReport(result);
```

This is fine.

Wait, let me look at line 449:
```
await Bun.write(outputPath, report);
```

And then line 451:
```
console.log(`Conversation dumps written to: ${config.conversationDumpDir}`);
```

And then line 453:
```
if (cleanup) {
  await cleanup();
}
```

Hmm, `cleanup` is called after the report is written. But the conversation dumps are written during `runBenchmark`. The `cleanup` function removes the temporary directory created by `extractTarGz`. If `runBenchmark` is done and the report is written, then cleanup is fine.

Wait, but `cleanup` is defined at line 230:
```
const { tasks: allTasks, cleanup } = await resolveFixtures(values.fixtures);
```

And `resolveFixtures` returns `cleanup` only for `.tar.gz` files. So if we extracted fixtures, we clean up after running. That's fine.

Let me think about this differently. Maybe the bug is in the `printUsage` function or in the `generateReportFilename` function. Let me look at `generateReportFilename` again:

```
function generateReportFilename(config: BenchmarkConfig, format: 'markdown' | 'json'): string {
  const modelName = config.model
    .split('/')
    .pop()!
    .replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]/g, '_');
  const variant = config.editVariant ?? 'replace';
  const timestamp = new Date()
    .toISOString()
    .replace(/:/g, '-')
    .replace(/\..+$/, '')
    .replace(/Z$/, 'Z');
  const ext = format === 'json' ? 'json' : 'md';
  return `runs/${modelName}_${variant}_${timestamp}.${ext}`;
}
```

Wait, `format` is used to determine `ext`. But `format` is passed as `'markdown' | 'json'`. The condition is `format === 'json' ? 'json' : 'md'`. This is correct.

Hmm, let me look at the `parseArgs` call again. The `values` object is destructured. At line 207:
```
const model = values.model!;
```

But `parseArgs` returns `values` with `model` having a default. That's fine.

Wait, I just realized something. At line 171-172 in the `parseArgs` options:
```
provider: { type: 'string' },
model: { type: 'string', default: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514' },
```

Hmm, the model name says `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` but the default at line 172 says `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`. Wait, let me check the actual text. The comment says "claude-sonnet-4-20250514" but the default string is `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`. That's fine because `anthropic/` is the provider prefix.

Actually, let me look at the `main` function again for any adjacent statements that might be in the wrong order. Let me look at lines 384-386:
```
const outputPath = values.output ?? generateReportFilename(config, formatType);
config.conversationDumpDir = await resolveConversationDumpDir(outputPath);
```

Hmm, `config.conversationDumpDir` is set after `outputPath` is computed. But `outputPath` depends on `config` which is already built. And `config.conversationDumpDir` doesn't affect `outputPath`. That's fine.

Wait, I should look at the `extractTarGz` function again:
```
async function extractTarGz(archivePath: string): Promise<{ dir: string; cleanupDir: string }> {
  const tempDirObj = await TempDir.create('@reach-benchmark-fixtures-');
  const tempDir = tempDirObj.path();
  try {
    const bytes = await Bun.file(archivePath).arrayBuffer();
    const archive = new Bun.Archive(bytes);
    const files = await archive.files();

    for (const [filePath, file] of files) {
      const destPath = path.join(tempDir, filePath);
      await Bun.write(destPath, file);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    await tempDirObj.remove();
    const message = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
    throw new Error(`Failed to extract archive: ${message}`, { cause: error });
  }

  return { dir: await resolveExtractedDir(tempDir), cleanupDir: tempDir };
}
```

Wait, `cleanupDir` is `tempDir`. But `dir` is `await resolveExtractedDir(tempDir)`. If `resolveExtractedDir` returns a subdirectory (e.g., `tempDir/extracted-dir`), then `cleanupDir` is `tempDir` and `dir` is `tempDir/extracted-dir`. When `cleanup` is called, it removes `tempDir`, which removes the subdirectory too. That's correct.

But wait, `resolveExtractedDir` is called before returning. In `resolveFixtures`, the cleanup function is:
```
cleanup: () => fs.promises.rm(extracted.cleanupDir, { recursive: true, force: true })
```

So `cleanupDir` is `tempDir`, and `dir` is the subdirectory. This is correct.

Let me look at `resolveExtractedDir` again:
```
async function resolveExtractedDir(tempDir: string): Promise<string> {
  const entries = await fs.promises.readdir(tempDir, { withFileTypes: true });
  const dirs = entries.filter((entry) => entry.isDirectory());
  const files = entries.filter((entry) => entry.isFile());
  if (dirs.length === 1 && files.length === 0) {
    return path.join(tempDir, dirs[0]!.name);
  }
  return tempDir;
}
```

This is correct. If there's exactly one directory and no files, it returns that subdirectory.

Hmm, let me look at the `LiveProgress` class again. At line 512-528:
```
if (event.result && !event.result.success && event.result.error) {
  this.#flushLine();
  console.log(
    `  [${event.taskId}] Run ${event.runIndex + 1}/${this.#runsPerTask} failed: ${event.result.error}`,
  );
  if (event.result.diff) {
    const diffLines = event.result.diff.split('\n').slice(0, 30);
    if (diffLines.length > 0) {
      console.log('  Diff (first 30 lines):');
      for (const line of diffLines) {
        console.log(`    ${line}`);
      }
      if (event.result.diff.split('\n').length > 30) {
        console.log('    ... (truncated)');
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Wait, `this.#flushLine()` is called inside `!this.#isTty` branch? No, it's called unconditionally. But then at line 531, if `!this.#isTty`, it logs a message. Let me check the flow:

At line 482, if `event.status === 'started'`, it increments `#started`, optionally logs, renders line, and returns.

At line 494, it increments `#completed`. Then at line 495, if `event.result`, it processes stats. Then at line 512, if `event.result && !event.result.success && event.result.error`, it flushes line, logs error, and optionally logs diff. Then at line 531, if `!this.#isTty`, it logs completion status. Then at line 536, it calls `#renderLine()`.

Wait, if `!this.#isTty` and `event.result && !event.result.success && event.result.error`, then it will:
1. Flush line
2. Log error
3. Log diff (if present)
4. Log "completed" or "failed" at line 533

But the line 533 will say "failed" because `event.result?.success` is false. So it would log the error and then log "failed". That's fine.

Actually, wait. If `event.result && !event.result.success && event.result.error` is true, then `event.result` exists. But the error block at line 512 is only entered if `event.result.error` exists. If the result is not successful but there is no `error`, it doesn't enter the error block, but still logs "failed" at line 531. That's fine.

Hmm, let me look at the `main` function again. Maybe I should look at the `runBenchmark` call:
```
const progress = new LiveProgress(tasksToRun.length * config.runsPerTask, config.runsPerTask);
const result = await runBenchmark(tasksToRun, config, (event) => {
  progress.handleEvent(event);
});
progress.finish();
```

This is correct.

Wait, I just noticed something. At line 400:
```
console.log(`Guided mode: ${config.guided ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}`);
```

And line 401:
```
console.log(`Max attempts: ${config.maxAttempts}`);
```

And line 402:
```
if (config.maxTurns !== undefined) {
  console.log(`Max turns per attempt: ${config.maxTurns}`);
}
```

Hmm, `maxTurns` is parsed at line 266, and it will always be defined because `values['max-turns']` has a default of `'24'`. But the check `if (config.maxTurns !== undefined)` is harmless.

Let me look at the `parseInt` calls. At line 278:
```
const maxAttempts = parseInt(values['max-attempts'] ?? '2', 10);
```

Wait, the default in parseArgs is `'1'`, but the fallback here is `'2'`. That's a bit inconsistent but not a bug.

Actually, wait. Let me look at the `parseArgs` defaults again:
```
'max-attempts': { type: 'string', default: '1' },
```

And at line 278:
```
const maxAttempts = parseInt(values['max-attempts'] ?? '2', 10);
```

The `??` operator only triggers if `values['max-attempts']` is `null` or `undefined`. Since parseArgs provides a default of `'1'`, the `?? '2'` will never trigger. So `maxAttempts` will always be `1` by default. This is fine - the parseArgs default takes precedence.

Wait, but what about `noOpRetryLimit` at line 284:
```
const noOpRetryLimit = parseInt(values['no-op-retry-limit'] ?? '2', 10);
```

The default in parseArgs is `'2'`, so the `?? '2'` is redundant but not a bug.

Let me look at the `model` and `provider` extraction again:
```
const model = values.model!;
const slashIndex = model.indexOf('/');
const provider =
  values.provider ?? (slashIndex !== -1 ? model.slice(0, slashIndex) : 'anthropic');
```

This is correct.

Wait, I should look at `resolveConversationDumpDir` more carefully. The function uses `fs.promises.stat` to check if the directory exists. But `stat` on a file that doesn't exist will throw ENOENT. If it exists, it returns the stats object, and the code falls through to create a timestamped path. But there's a subtle bug: if the preferred path exists but is a directory, it appends a timestamp. But wait - what if `preferredPath` exists as a file? It still appends a timestamp. This is actually correct behavior for avoiding collisions.

Actually, let me think about this differently. The task says "Two adjacent statements are in the wrong order." This is a very specific hint. It means two statements that are next to each other should be swapped. Let me look for any two adjacent statements where one depends on the other.

Let me look at the top of the file again:
```
import * as fs from 'node:fs';
import * as path from 'node:path';
import { parseArgs } from 'node:util';
import { type ResolvedThinkingLevel, ThinkingLevel } from '@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core';
import { Effort, THINKING_EFFORTS } from '@oh-my-pi/pi-ai';
import { padding } from '@oh-my-pi/pi-tui';
import { TempDir } from '@oh-my-pi/pi-utils';
import { generateJsonReport, generateReport } from './report';
import { type BenchmarkConfig, type ProgressEvent, runBenchmark } from './runner';
import { type EditTask, loadTasksFromDir, validateFixturesFromDir } from './tasks';
```

Wait! `import { Effort, THINKING_EFFORTS } from '@oh-my-pi/pi-ai';` and `import { padding } from '@oh-my-pi/pi-tui';` - are these adjacent statements in the wrong order? Maybe `pi-tui` should come before `pi-ai`? That's alphabetical order. But the current order is:
- `pi-agent-core`
- `pi-ai`
- `pi-tui`
- `pi-utils`

That's alphabetical. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe the bug is in `parseThinkingLevel` function. Let me look at it again:
```
function parseThinkingLevel(value: string | null | undefined): ResolvedThinkingLevel | undefined {
  return value !== undefined &&
    value !== null &&
    [ThinkingLevel.Off, ...THINKING_EFFORTS].includes(value as ResolvedThinkingLevel)
    ? (value as ResolvedThinkingLevel)
    : undefined;
}
```

Hmm, `ThinkingLevel.Off` is imported from `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core`, and `THINKING_EFFORTS` is imported from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`. This is correct.

Wait, let me look at the `generateReportFilename` function again:
```
function generateReportFilename(config: BenchmarkConfig, format: 'markdown' | 'json'): string {
  const modelName = config.model
    .split('/')
    .pop()!
    .replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]/g, '_');
  const variant = config.editVariant ?? 'replace';
  const timestamp = new Date()
    .toISOString()
    .replace(/:/g, '-')
    .replace(/\..+$/, '')
    .replace(/Z$/, 'Z');
  const ext = format === 'json' ? 'json' : 'md';
  return `runs/${modelName}_${variant}_${timestamp}.${ext}`;
}
```

Wait, `.replace(/Z$/, 'Z')` - that's replacing a trailing `Z` with `Z`. That's a no-op! But that's not "two adjacent statements in the wrong order", it's a bug in a single line.

Actually, let me look at the `timestamp` line more carefully:
```
  const timestamp = new Date()
    .toISOString()
    .replace(/:/g, '-')
    .replace(/\..+$/, '')
    .replace(/Z$/, 'Z');
```

Wait, `.replace(/\..+$/, '')` removes the milliseconds and timezone, and then `.replace(/Z$/, 'Z')` is a no-op. But that's not two adjacent statements in the wrong order.

Actually, let me look at the `toISOString` chain:
```
.toISOString()          // "2023-10-01T12:34:56.789Z"
.replace(/:/g, '-')      // "2023-10-01T12-34-56.789Z"
.replace(/\..+$/, '')    // "2023-10-01T12-34-56Z"
.replace(/Z$/, 'Z')      // "2023-10-01T12-34-56Z" (no-op)
```

Hmm, but `.replace(/\..+$/, '')` removes the dot and everything after it. But what about timezones? `toISOString()` always returns UTC, so it always ends with `Z`. The `.replace(/\..+$/, '')` removes the milliseconds and the `Z`! Wait, `Z` is part of the `.+` match because `.` matches any character including `Z`. So `2023-10-01T12:34:56.789Z` with `.replace(/\..+$/, '')` becomes `2023-10-01T12:34:56` (without the `Z`). Then `.replace(/Z$/, 'Z')` doesn't match anything because there's no `Z` at the end. So the `.replace(/Z$/, 'Z')` is indeed a no-op.

But the bug is about "two adjacent statements are in the wrong order", not about a no-op replacement.

Wait, let me look at the `main` function body again. Let me read the entire thing more carefully. Maybe I should look at `runner.ts` or `tasks.ts` to understand what functions are supposed to do? But the bug is in `index.ts`.

Let me look at the `extractTarGz` function:
```
async function extractTarGz(archivePath: string): Promise<{ dir: string; cleanupDir: string }> {
  const tempDirObj = await TempDir.create('@reach-benchmark-fixtures-');
  const tempDir = tempDirObj.path();
  try {
    const bytes = await Bun.file(archivePath).arrayBuffer();
    const archive = new Bun.Archive(bytes);
    const files = await archive.files();

    for (const [filePath, file] of files) {
      const destPath = path.join(tempDir, filePath);
      await Bun.write(destPath, file);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    await tempDirObj.remove();
    const message = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
    throw new Error(`Failed to extract archive: ${message}`, { cause: error });
  }

  return { dir: await resolveExtractedDir(tempDir), cleanupDir: tempDir };
}
```

Wait, is `Bun.Archive` correct? It should probably be `Bun.Tar` or something. But `Bun.Archive` might be a real API. I don't know. But this is a single line, not two adjacent statements.

Let me think about this differently. What if the two adjacent statements are:
```
const model = values.model!;
const slashIndex = model.indexOf('/');
```

Should `slashIndex` be computed before `model`? No, `slashIndex` depends on `model`.

What about:
```
const provider =
  values.provider ?? (slashIndex !== -1 ? model.slice(0, slashIndex) : 'anthropic');
```

Hmm, maybe `provider` should be computed before `model`? No, `provider` depends on `slashIndex` which depends on `model`.

Wait, let me look at the `parseArgs` call again:
```
const { values } = parseArgs({
  options: {
    provider: { type: 'string' },
    model: { type: 'string', default: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514' },
    thinking: { type: 'string', default: 'low' },
    runs: { type: 'string', default: '1' },
    timeout: { type: 'string', default: '120000' },
    'max-turns': { type: 'string', default: '24' },
    'task-concurrency': { type: 'string', default: '16' },
    tasks: { type: 'string' },
    fixtures: { type: 'string' },
    output: { type: 'string' },
    format: { type: 'string', default: 'markdown' },

    'auto-format': { type: 'boolean', default: false },
    guided: { type: 'boolean', default: false },

    'edit-fuzzy': { type: 'string' },
    'edit-fuzzy-threshold': { type: 'string' },
    'max-tasks': { type: 'string', default: '80' },
    list: { type: 'boolean', default: false },
    help: { type: 'boolean', default: false },
  },
  allowPositionals: true,
});
```

Wait, maybe the bug is in the `options` object? Like two adjacent options in the wrong order? But the task says "statements" not "object properties".

Let me look at the `LiveProgress` constructor:
```
constructor(totalRuns: number, runsPerTask: number) {
  this.#totalRuns = totalRuns;
  this.#runsPerTask = runsPerTask;
  this.#isTty = Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY);
}
```

Hmm, is `process.stdout.isTTY` checked before setting other fields? No, that's fine.

Wait, let me look at the `handleEvent` method again. At line 493:
```
this.#completed += 1;
```

This is outside the `if (event.result)` block. So it increments completed even if there's no result. But for `started` events, the function returns early at line 491. So `#completed` is only incremented for non-started events. That's correct.

Actually, wait. Let me look at line 512:
```
if (event.result && !event.result.success && event.result.error) {
```

And line 531:
```
if (!this.#isTty) {
```

If `!this.#isTty` and `event.result && !event.result.success && event.result.error`, then at line 513 it calls `this.#flushLine()`. But `this.#flushLine()` is a no-op if `!this.#isTty`. Then it logs the error. Then at line 531, since `!this.#isTty`, it logs the status. Then at line 536, `this.#renderLine()` is called, but it's a no-op if `!this.#isTty`.

So the behavior is:
- TTY: render progress bar
- Non-TTY: print started message, then for completed runs, print failed message with diff if applicable, then print completed/failed status

Wait, but for non-TTY, it prints both "failed: <error>" and "failed" on separate lines. That's fine.

Hmm, let me look at the `main` function again. Maybe the bug is in the order of these two lines:
```
const outputPath = values.output ?? generateReportFilename(config, formatType);
config.conversationDumpDir = await resolveConversationDumpDir(outputPath);
```

Wait, `config` is built at line 362-383. But `config.conversationDumpDir` is added at line 385. But `outputPath` uses `generateReportFilename(config, formatType)` which uses `config` fields. This is fine.

But what if `config.conversationDumpDir` should be set before `outputPath` is computed? No, `outputPath` doesn't depend on `conversationDumpDir`.

Wait, let me look at the `resolveConversationDumpDir` function again:
```
async function resolveConversationDumpDir(outputPath: string): Promise<string> {
  const parsed = path.parse(outputPath);
  const preferredPath = path.join(parsed.dir, `${parsed.name}.dump`);
  try {
    await fs.promises.stat(preferredPath);
  } catch (error) {
    if ((error as NodeJS.ErrnoException).code === 'ENOENT') {
      return preferredPath;
    }
    throw error;
  }
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
  return path.join(parsed.dir, `${parsed.name}.${timestamp}.dump`);
}
```

Wait, `fs.promises.stat(preferredPath)` - if `preferredPath` exists, it returns without error, and the function falls through to append a timestamp. But what if `preferredPath` is a directory? The `stat` will succeed. Then it appends a timestamp. But what if `preferredPath` is a directory that already exists and we want to use it? The function creates a new path instead.

Actually, this is the correct behavior for "generate a unique directory name". If it already exists, create a new one with a timestamp.

But wait, in the `main` function at line 449:
```
await Bun.write(outputPath, report);
```

And then line 451:
```
console.log(`Conversation dumps written to: ${config.conversationDumpDir}`);
```

But `config.conversationDumpDir` is created at line 385. If the report is written to `outputPath`, and the conversation dump dir is created at `resolveConversationDumpDir(outputPath)`, then the directory is created when the conversation dumps are written, not when `resolveConversationDumpDir` is called. `resolveConversationDumpDir` just computes the path, it doesn't create the directory. So the `stat` call at line 49 might be checking if the directory exists from a previous run.

Hmm, but `resolveConversationDumpDir` returns a path, and then `runBenchmark` writes conversation dumps to that path. So the `stat` call is checking if the path already exists from a previous run. If it exists, it appends a timestamp. This is correct.

Let me think about this more carefully. Maybe I should look at the `tasks.ts` import:
```
import { type EditTask, loadTasksFromDir, validateFixturesFromDir } from './tasks';
```

And `validateFixturesFromDir` is called at line 218:
```
const issues = await validateFixturesFromDir(values.fixtures);
```

But `values.fixtures` is optional. The check at line 217 is:
```
if (values['check-fixtures'] && values.fixtures) {
```

Wait, `values.fixtures` is required to validate fixtures. But what if the user wants to check built-in fixtures? The default fixtures are loaded at line 230. So if `check-fixtures` is true but `fixtures` is not provided, it won't validate anything. This is a bug! But it's not "two adjacent statements in the wrong order".

Actually, let me look at line 217 and 218 again:
```
if (values['check-fixtures'] && values.fixtures) {
    const issues = await validateFixturesFromDir(values.fixtures);
```

If we want to check built-in fixtures, we need to resolve the fixtures first. So the correct order might be:
```
const { tasks: allTasks, cleanup } = await resolveFixtures(values.fixtures);
if (values['check-fixtures']) {
    const issues = await validateFixturesFromDir(values.fixtures);
```

Wait, but `validateFixturesFromDir` takes a directory path, not the tasks array. And `resolveFixtures` returns tasks. If `values.fixtures` is not provided, `resolveFixtures` uses the default path. But `validateFixturesFromDir` doesn't have the same default logic.

Actually, looking at `resolveFixtures`:
```
async function resolveFixtures(
  fixturesArg?: string,
): Promise<{ tasks: EditTask[]; cleanup?: () => Promise<void> }> {
  fixturesArg ??= path.join(import.meta.dir, '../fixtures.tar.gz');

  if (fixturesArg.endsWith('.tar.gz') || fixturesArg.endsWith('.tgz')) {
    const extracted = await extractTarGz(fixturesArg);
    return {
      tasks: await loadTasksFromDir(extracted.dir),
      cleanup: () => fs.promises.rm(extracted.cleanupDir, { recursive: true, force: true }),
    };
  }

  return { tasks: await loadTasksFromDir(fixturesArg) };
}
```

And at line 217:
```
if (values['check-fixtures'] && values.fixtures) {
```

If `values.fixtures` is not provided, `values['check-fixtures']` is true, but `values.fixtures` is undefined, so the check doesn't run. But the user probably wants to check the built-in fixtures. The fix would be to not check `values.fixtures` and instead call `resolveFixtures` first. But that would require more than just swapping two adjacent statements.

Wait, let me look at the `resolveFixtures` function call at line 230:
```
const { tasks: allTasks, cleanup } = await resolveFixtures(values.fixtures);
```

And the `check-fixtures` block at line 217-228:
```
if (values['check-fixtures'] && values.fixtures) {
    const issues = await validateFixturesFromDir(values.fixtures);
    ...
    process.exit(1);
  }
```

These are adjacent blocks. But `values.fixtures` is used directly in `validateFixturesFromDir`, while `resolveFixtures` has a default. So if `check-fixtures` is true but `fixtures` is not provided, the built-in fixtures are not validated. This is a bug.

But the task says "The fix may involve multiple lines." So swapping two adjacent statements might involve multiple lines. Let me think about what two adjacent statements could be swapped.

Actually, wait. The `check-fixtures` block and the `resolveFixtures` block are at lines 217-228 and 230. They are not adjacent statements - they are adjacent blocks.

Hmm, let me look at the code around line 217 again:
```
if (values['check-fixtures'] && values.fixtures) {
    const issues = await validateFixturesFromDir(values.fixtures);
    if (issues.length === 0) {
      console.log('Fixtures OK');
      process.exit(0);
    }
    console.error('Fixture validation failed:');
    for (const issue of issues) {
      console.error(`  - ${issue.taskId}: ${issue.message}`);
    }
    process.exit(1);
  }

  const { tasks: allTasks, cleanup } = await resolveFixtures(values.fixtures);
```

Wait, if `values['check-fixtures']` is true, we should validate fixtures. But `resolveFixtures` is not called before the validation. If `values.fixtures` is not provided, `validateFixturesFromDir` is not called. But `resolveFixtures` has a default.

Actually, the bug might be simpler. Let me look at the `validateFixturesFromDir` call. If we swap the two blocks:
```
const { tasks: allTasks, cleanup } = await resolveFixtures(values.fixtures);

if (values['check-fixtures']) {
    const issues = await validateFixturesFromDir(allTasks);
    ...
}
```

But `validateFixturesFromDir` takes a directory path, not tasks. So that's not a simple swap.

Wait, let me look at `tasks.ts` to see what `validateFixturesFromDir` actually expects. I don't have the `tasks.ts` file in the workspace. The workspace only has `index.ts`. Let me check if there's a `tasks.ts` or other files. The tree only shows `index.ts`. So I can't read `tasks.ts`.

Let me think about this differently. The hint says "Two adjacent statements are in the wrong order." Maybe the bug is in the `extractTarGz` function:

```
    for (const [filePath, file] of files) {
      const destPath = path.join(tempDir, filePath);
      await Bun.write(destPath, file);
    }
```

Wait, `Bun.write(destPath, file)` - does `file` here need to be awaited? `archive.files()` returns a promise that resolves to an array of entries. But what is `file`? It might be a `Blob` or `File` or a `Promise<Blob>`. If `file` is a promise, then `Bun.write` might need to await it. But that's not "two adjacent statements in the wrong order".

Let me look at the `resolveExtractedDir` function again:
```
async function resolveExtractedDir(tempDir: string): Promise<string> {
  const entries = await fs.promises.readdir(tempDir, { withFileTypes: true });
  const dirs = entries.filter((entry) => entry.isDirectory());
  const files = entries.filter((entry) => entry.isFile());
  if (dirs.length === 1 && files.length === 0) {
    return path.join(tempDir, dirs[0]!.name);
  }
  return tempDir;
}
```

Wait, `dirs.length === 1 && files.length === 0` - but what about symlinks? `isFile()` and `isDirectory()` might not handle symlinks. But that's not two adjacent statements in the wrong order.

Let me look at `LiveProgress` again. At line 573:
```
#renderLine(): void {
    if (!this.#isTty) {
      return;
    }
    const successRate = this.#completed > 0 ? (this.#success / this.#completed) * 100 : 0;
    const editRate =
      this.#totalEdits > 0 ? (this.#totalEditSuccesses / this.#totalEdits) * 100 : 100;
    const avgInput = this.#completed > 0 ? Math.round(this.#totalInput / this.#completed) : 0;
    const avgOutput = this.#completed > 0 ? Math.round(this.#totalOutput / this.#completed) : 0;
    const avgDuration = this.#completed > 0 ? Math.round(this.#totalDuration / this.#completed) : 0;
    const inFlight = this.#started - this.#completed;
    const bar = this.#renderBar(this.#completed, this.#totalRuns, 20);
    const line = `  ${bar} ${this.#completed}/${this.#totalRuns} task=${successRate.toFixed(0)}% edit=${editRate.toFixed(0)}% tok=${avgInput}/${avgOutput} ${avgDuration}ms r/e/w=${this.#totalReads}/${this.#totalEdits}/${this.#totalWrites} fly=${inFlight}`;
    this.#writeLine(line);
  }
```

This looks fine.

Wait, let me look at the `printUsage` function. At line 60:
```
function printUsage(tasks?: EditTask[]): void {
  const taskList = tasks
    ? tasks.map((t) => `  ${t.id.padEnd(30)} ${t.name}`).join('\n')
    : '  (use --list to see available tasks)';
```

And at line 99:
```
Available Tasks:
${taskList}
```

Wait, the `Available Tasks:` heading is printed regardless of whether `tasks` is provided. But if `tasks` is not provided, it prints `(use --list to see available tasks)`. That's fine.

Let me look at the `parseThinkingLevel` function again:
```
function parseThinkingLevel(value: string | null | undefined): ResolvedThinkingLevel | undefined {
  return value !== undefined &&
    value !== null &&
    [ThinkingLevel.Off, ...THINKING_EFFORTS].includes(value as ResolvedThinkingLevel)
    ? (value as ResolvedThinkingLevel)
    : undefined;
}
```

Wait, `value !== undefined && value !== null` - this is checking if value is not null/undefined. But `value` is typed as `string | null | undefined`. The `includes` check on `[ThinkingLevel.Off, ...THINKING_EFFORTS]` is correct. But what about `ThinkingLevel.Off`? Is `ThinkingLevel.Off` a string like `'off'`? Probably.

Actually, looking at the import: `import { type ResolvedThinkingLevel, ThinkingLevel } from '@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core';`. `ThinkingLevel` might be an enum or a string union.

Let me look at the `Effort` import: `import { Effort, THINKING_EFFORTS } from '@oh-my-pi/pi-ai';`. And at line 243:
```
let thinkingLevel: ResolvedThinkingLevel = Effort.Low;
```

So `Effort.Low` is a `ResolvedThinkingLevel`. And `THINKING_EFFORTS` is an array of `ResolvedThinkingLevel`. And `ThinkingLevel.Off` is also a `ResolvedThinkingLevel`. So `parseThinkingLevel` checks if the value is in the array.

But wait, `Effort.Low` and `ThinkingLevel.Off` are from different packages. Maybe the import order is wrong? Like `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` should be imported before `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core`? No, that's not a statement order issue.

Let me look at the `main` function again more carefully. I'll read the whole thing in one go to see all adjacent statements.
